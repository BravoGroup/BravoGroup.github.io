Olson","Okay.  I am the Chief Executive Officer, and I have been with La Red since February of 2001.","I'm sorry, 2002.  Sorry, 2002.  It's all a blur.  Sixteen and a half years, anyway.","Well, La Red Health Center is a federally qualifying healthcare site.  I'm not sure if you're familiar with the FQHCs, and we are the second largest FQHC delivery site in Delaware.  There's three in total, and we've had sort of a tangential relationship with the Healthcare Association.","I mean, I certainly know Wayne Smith and many of the staff members there and some of the advocacy they're doing for the hospital system, but our direct—our relationship with them, as I said, has been very marginal.","There’s certainly a lot of overlap.  Delaware's a very small state.  We tend to all know each other.  We tend to all participate in many of the same initiatives.  I think one of the things that is unique about La Red Health Center is that, unlike the other FQHC systems, we also manage a school-based wellness center, and all the other school-based wellness centers in Delaware are—outside of the one we manage—are managed by hospital systems, and so I know that Delaware—the Delaware Health Association has done a lot of lobbying and activities around that, and reimbursement and fundraising related to the general legislature here for school-based health center activities, but we have not really been at the table with a lot of that.  We're sort of an afterthought, because we are—we only manage one school system, where most of the hospitals have multiple schools that they're managing.","Well, I think understanding their agenda has helped us that are standing up on the sidelines understand the direction that the Healthcare Association is going in, because outside of the Association, obviously as a CEO of a healthcare system, I interact quite a bit with the CEOs of the hospital systems, and so therefore, there is a lot of, for lack of a better term, incestuous behavior here with Delaware where we all know each other.  We all, as I said, are working on pretty much the same initiatives.","Exactly.  Exactly.  I mean, it's the nature—I mean, there's less than a million people living in Delaware, and the healthcare industry is even smaller than that, so we all tend to work on the same task forces, the same committees, the same legislative issues, and so forth.","I think, basically, having a consolidated voice for the hospitals and advocating for policy changes or policy decisions, especially at the healthcare commission meetings on a monthly basis.","I'm sorry.  It's a healthcare commission, not a committee.","Yes.  I attend those on a regular basis.  They’re monthly meetings.","I think, from my perspective—and I don't know if you've spoken to the other FQHCs in the state—but from my perspective, I think just improved communication about what they're doing and what some of the outcomes are of their efforts so that I, and perhaps my colleagues, are better informed in terms of where the hospital is—hospitals are putting their emphasis, because it certainly would help those of us who are trying to offload some of the non-urgent care from their ERs, or reduce the high flyers, as we call them, into multiple hospital admissions.","Well, right now there isn't a whole lot of communication, so anything's better than nothing.","A monthly newsletter; ongoing or even quarterly newsletter; ongoing email communication; more than just a hallway conversation.","Maybe sharing their strategic plan, if they have one, or what they—what the hot topics are that they are really concerned about so that those of us in the undertow basically have a better understanding of the direction they're headed.","Basically, what they're looking for in terms of outcomes, where—and where they're headed, and so that as we do our strategic planning, where we have some alignment.","Obviously, first and foremost, strong leadership.  I think I may be a bit different than some of the other people you've interviewed in the sense that the FQHCs also have their own trade association, and it's combined between Delaware and Maryland—the Mid-Atlantic Association of Community Health Centers—and I have a very biased opinion about that, because I feel like that organization serves Maryland very well, but doesn't do a very good job at serving Delaware, so I guess I'm kind of thinking that maybe the hospital association, in some way, could help supplant some of the legislative issues for the FQHCs, as well as the hospitals, instead of our trade association.","As well, yes, exactly.","Yes.","I mean, they're often common agendas, and it would be nice to have a voice, but again, Delaware's very, very unique because we all know all the policymakers as well.  It's easy to pick up the phone and call the Secretary of Health and Social Services or the Governor or whoever it is, so it's a very different landscape here than probably in most states.","On the federal side, I mean, it's the same thing.  We know our congressional delegates, and we can't keep them out of our centers.  They're here all the time, which is a good thing.  I'm not being sarcastic about that.","I don't really know, to be honest with you.  I think the state has its own agenda.  I think the state, you may have heard, is the recipient of a CMMS grant to implement a state innovation model, and we're in the midst of—I think we're like five or six years into that now, and they're getting ready to change the whole reimbursement structure here in the state so that it's outcome-driven as opposed to encounter-driven, and I think the state leadership has been very aggressive in terms of moving that initiative forward, so I don't know how the Delaware Health Association connects into that.  Does that make sense?","I don't know how successful they have been at influencing any of that.  At the same time, we've pretty much moved towards a statewide ACO model, so again, I don't know how the Delaware Health Association has played into that.","Oh, ACO.","Accountable Care Organization.","Yes.","I don't know concretely what part they play right now in any of that, so I'm not sure.  I'm not sure what I'm trying to say, I guess.  I don't know how strong a voice they have in the direction that the state is moving.  That's what I'm saying.","It’s generally Wayne and Lisa (phon).","Lisa and I serve on the Board of the Delaware Rural Health Initiative as well, so I know Lisa in that context, outside of DH—DEHA.","No.  I would say no.","Well, I think from the Association's viewpoint, maybe some feedback loop that talked about—sort of a survey that elicited some kind of satisfaction from its members and those of us on the sidelines would be helpful to them on some periodic basis.  I know that with our state innovation model, that was one of the big critiques that kept coming out, that they weren't communicating enough, and now they're actually sending out all kinds of surveys, and five or six emails a day, so they're—they've gone—spun the pendulum the other direction almost to overkill, but then at least you can pick and choose what you want to read about and know about.","Maybe just in terms of having some voice into their strategic thinking and the direction they're moving in.  I mean, I think obviously the hospitals are the leaders, and I respect that, but for those of us that have large outpatient practices and tend to work extremely close with the hospitals, it would just be beneficial to have an understanding of the broader landscape, and I think that's the piece that's missing.","That's an interesting question.  I like that question.  I think it would be someone that is well-known, well-respected.  I think, certainly, somebody that's looked to as a voice in the industry, a leader in the industry, and plays a role in—perhaps plays a role in affecting change.  I think it's a trusted entity.  Beyond that, I don't have any other comments.","I think that's more my rapport with Wayne and Lisa.","That I know them as individuals, and I know them better as individuals than I do as an entity, if that makes sense.","No, just I'd like to comment that I think it's really great that they're reaching out to folks like myself, and I don't know who other—who else they've involved in this process, but I think it's good that they're reaching out to others beyond their immediate membership to hear about our perceptions of their organization.","Thank you, and we've also, for the second year in a row, been chosen as one of the top 100 workplaces to work in Delaware.","(Inaudible).","Sure.  Thanks a lot.","You too.","Bryan Townsend","I’m State Senator for the 11th Senatorial District and then Chair of the Senate Health, Children & Social Services Committee.","Quite ironically, notwithstanding my role as Chair of the Health Committee, I actually have not had significant interactions previously.","I went from not being a member of the Committee, for the first four—I think the first four-plus years of my Senate service, to all of a sudden joining the Committee and being Chair of the Committee. I had been a recipient of email lists and their general outreach but there really hadn’t been, hadn’t been much interaction with me up until my role as Chair of the Committee.","We have a bicameral legislature like all but one state does; bills can start in either chamber, although revenue bills have to start in the House. The most basic framing would simply be that almost any health-related bill would come through the Senate Committee, either as the starting committee or as the second chamber, if it starts in the House. Insurance bills more than likely go through Insurance Committee but my role as regards to DHA is simply a lot of the bills that relate to healthcare would be coming through my Committee so I would facilitate the committee process much more on the administrative side, schedule the hearings, lead the hearings, and then facilitate the legislation.","I really don’t have—it’s interesting, when Wayne had contacted me about this—I don’t specifically have much of a history or impression. I mean, as someone who wasn’t a member of the committee for the first four-years, I certainly knew of DHA generally. I mean, I knew it was a very active group, I knew of Wayne. It’s kind of hard not to, I guess, when someone’s a state legislator and then goes to become—I think the highest compensated lobbyist. There was a news articles this past month or so, month and a half, that reported on lobbying activity and DHA and Wayne was the—was the most active lobbying group in Dover this year.","I would like sort of positive arguments on the facts, on the merits, especially when it comes to healthcare groups, wanting good outcomes sufficiently but that’s just now how—that’s not how it works, unfortunately. I would hope that’s the way it would happen but that said, the associations tend to be as territorial as they need to be, which is the way it’s structured and that’s just how it works.","You’ve got Medical Society of Delaware for the doctors, you’ve got long-term care facility trade associations, you’ve got community health center-type coalitions, you’ve only got one main health insurer at this point, it’s a small state so they wield a big bat.","I’m trying to think, I’m sure I’m missing a very obvious…","Sure, that covers it generally. I’m sure there are other (inaudible) groups but Delaware has got a small jurisdiction, a really concentrated market, and DHA is kind of like the parallel to the insurers with regard to a pretty concentrated—I guess I would say, and I’m sure found this out eventually anyway, is that I have noticed that there are times when DHA makes a statement or represents something in Dover, in the legislature where—I know that some of its members don’t feel that same way. It’s on me to go around figuring out why things happen that way, when you’re part of an association with multiple members and clearly, so many times you take positions that members don’t all agree with. But I do think that—Delaware has a small number of hospitals, given its size, and so it’s not really hard to figure out when one hospital’s not really happy with the way something is poised to go.","That could be what it is. Also, I’ve seen maybe more is sort of one person’s political read in messaging something or taking a position on something, might be very different from what leadership or stakeholders in the individual hospital might feel about the issue. It’s not so much that one hospital has more pull on a specific issue. I think it’s more just sort of like, there’s the political world. Then you step out of that and you—I mean, politics is everywhere, right? Politics is (inaudible) too but there’s a political world and the legislature and then you step out of it and go to the hospital, and they might be like, wait a minute, why did the group do this? Or why is this happening this way? It’s like, oh, well, you guys pushed for that, and they’d be like what? Did we really? Why?","Just generally, putting—being very bold in leading the direction of efficient, effective patient care first. I mean, everybody says it, right, everyone in healthcare says that’s what they want. But if it ever, ever, ever, results in a cut to any kind of funding or compensation to the specific entity, then all of a sudden it’s like, well, wait a minute, we didn’t mean that when we said we wanted efficient, effective patient care.","I would just like to see a—it’s a very robust group, it’s a very robust industry leading hospitals, and it would be very helpful just to see as much leadership as possible on a much more effective patient healthcare system.","My apologies; I’ll be on mute occasionally because I’m eating breakfast.","No, no, no. I heard your question; if I delay a couple—a few seconds, it’s because I’m finishing chewing. I will say though, your question’s a little bit general. Are you referring to…?","In terms of how do they currently balance or…?","Leading the conversation.","I’ve talked to individual hospitals that I would love to follow the path that they’re charting. But then you take that down and put it through the DHA process and have it come out in the legislature with an official position of some sort, or statement of some sort, or tactic of some sort and it’s sort of like, well, that’s not particularly inspirational. But I would—we need leaders—it’s a tough nut—healthcare reform as we know it is a very tough nut to crack, you need leaders in it, you need people who might ultimately have to take a position that is against the way they benefit under the current framework. If you don’t have that, we’re not going to make progress so I would like—it would be nice to—for hospitals, DHA to take that kind of approach. Where it’s sort of like, look, here’s where the current system is, some of us are doing very well under that but obviously, overall, it’s not sustainable and we want to be part of the solution even if it means a very different framework and we have to adapt to.","Sure, you can get everybody in the room and you can make a decision if you want to.","The question is, do you want to? Or do you want to make it look like you’re making a big decision even if you’re not? But yes, generally to your question, sure, Delaware’s has that opportunity because of our intimate size.","Make it a more effective partner? Bear in mind that my opinion’s biased, right.","Biased by my values and biased by my read on how to achieve—best way to achieve the outcomes that some people say they want to achieve. Bearing all that in mind; yes, it’s a juggernaut of an organization. I kind of smile when you said, and both of you have said it now, I think, DHA works—or trade associations like it, I mean, I don’t know if there is a trade association like DHA in the Delaware state level. Certainly, as recently indicted by the newspaper analysis of lobbying activity, I think it’s by far and away the most active lobbying group. I think its leaders, by far and away, the most highly compensated individual.","I’m not sure why this is a profound question. I think I’m not sure what to make of it, quite frankly, of (inaudible). But like I said at the very beginning, the fact that I—four or five years in the State Legislature before there was any real kind of overlap, I think, was interesting. In hindsight, it’s interesting. I don’t know. I think, again, in hindsight, not that anyone expected me to be a member of the Health Committee all of a sudden, and become Chair all of a sudden. But when I think in hindsight, those first years, I think maybe DHA, there could have been ways they could have approached the rank and file legislator and kind of—I don’t know, been a facilitator of information or of expressing positions of the industry. I mean, it’s kind of a weird answer to a defined question but it’s more in hindsight, I guess, much of the relationship there, it’s pretty atypical, I think. I’m not quite sure why that happens.","Are either of you sports fans?","Which sports are your favorites?","Sorry, Evan, you said football, and Ronnie, what?","Soccer, okay. I’m not sure I can come up with a soccer analogy, just the player (inaudible). I’m trying to do an ostentatious soccer player; I’m sure that—I’m sure I can come up with some of the more outspoken European players over the years. But I’ll do football for Evan; if they were a person with attributes, I kind of view them as like a combination of like Rob Gronkowski, JJ Watt, and a Kansas City Chief tight-end Kelsey, I think that’s his last name. They’re just like huge; they’re a huge entity that, at least by every metric that I’ve seen and heard in the healthcare sphere, and as a person, the attributes if they were a person? They’re a—bull in a china shop is not the right term, but gentle giant is also not the right term; it’s sort of somewhere in the middle, trending towards bull, I guess, and maybe more like a bull in a china shop but it’s a quiet bull. You don’t know that it’s mulling around until after you close up the shop for the night and you’re like, whoa, what happened to all of the china?","Sorry, if that’s the—that’s probably the weirdest answer you’ve ever received, my apologies.","It seems to. I mean, it seems they have a very—sort of upfront, very forward, very clear transparent sort of process, or whether it’s more that they do something to kind of like (inaudible) behind the scenes. They seem to have a major, major role in legislation.","To Ronnie real quick, this is the soccer; this might not be entirely appropriate, but Vinnie Jones (phon) former footballer from…","Yes, okay, there you go.","Sure.","Certainly, appreciate it. Good luck with your project, and anything else you guys are doing and be well.","David Bentz","I’m a State Representative from the 18th District, which is located in Newark, New Castle area, and I've been elected for almost two years now, and I serve as Chair of the House Health and Human Development Committee.","I mean, I work closely with their Government Relations Team on legislation affecting hospitals and other healthcare facilities in the state. It's been a good working relationship with lots of lines of communication, and I’ve found everybody I’ve worked with so far to be very professional, and they understand the way things work in the state, and they're good partners—good business partners, good people to work with.","Yes. At least in my interactions, really, just being with their Government Relations Team, but they understand the politics of the state. They understand how to get things done in the state; when they need to give a little bit, and when they can get a little bit. They just seem to be very reasonable and rational individuals to work with, which is a nice thing to get, because sometimes that's not always the case.","There was a bill last year, in 2016, would have been—that I was working on where there was some opposition; where they were opposing what I was trying to do for a while, but again, they were willing to continue to talk, to keep lines of dialogue open until we were able to get to a compromise point, so that was really it. A couple of bills we did with them last year, in 2017, last session, that were pretty much non-controversial, so there wasn't a whole lot of, at least, work on our end that had to—my end that had to get done. A lot of the groundwork and support had already been built up by the Government Relations Team so that the bills were pretty much slam dunks.","The opposition wasn't necessarily with the bill’s intention, in that it was really just in the execution of the bill. There was certain legal protections that the hospitals wanted in the bill. I understand that litigation is a constant cost driver for the healthcare industry and hospitals, so wanting certain protections against what they may deem as unnecessary lawsuits or unnecessary liability is certainly something I understand, but it caused a rift with the legal community that does want people to have more access to the courts, and neither side was really opposed to what the bill was trying to do. There was just some disagreement on how to execute the policy, and we were able to get both sides engaged in dialogue. Both sides remained committed to trying to find a solution, because both, I think, saw the merits in the policy that we were trying to do in the legislature, and they were both able to give a little bit and work on the wording of the bill so that it was something they could both live with.","In my previous position, I was a staff person for the previous Health and Human Development Chair in the House, so I had worked with, again, this is our Government Relations Team when I was a staffer. I wasn't quite as involved in the dialogue, but certainly from the perspective of the Committee Chair, I saw his perspective of working with them, so I had had some interaction. I knew several of their government relations folks, the higher-ups in the hospital's themselves, so I did have some advanced knowledge of what they were about.","I mean, I would just—I view them as the industry organization—the trade organization of the healthcare facilities in the state. At least, in my interaction working with them, they represent the hospitals on matters facing the legislature.","I mean, I can't speak to what they do outside of Legislative Hall, whether they do that well. Is that what you're asking, or are you just asking more in my interactions with them?","Sure. Whether they do well, I mean, like I said, I think they're all professionals, so they understand motivations of, I guess, other interest groups that may be lobbying on similar issues, whether it be healthcare personnel like doctors or nurses, insurance companies. They understand the different levers of influence that are acting on legislators, and they understand the legislators themselves and their core motivations, and, like I said, they seem, in my interactions so far, willing to work towards—now I haven't had a policy proposal that they were against on the merits of the policy yet, but as far as when they don't see a—when they don't find themselves in opposition of the policy—on the merits of the policy, they are—seem to be willing to take part in a dialogue that can get everybody on the same page in an agreement. I haven't really had an interaction with them when they were just outright opposed to something I was trying to do, or some piece of legislation that was in the committee, so I don't really know how things would proceed from that sort of standpoint, but they seem to be good at, at least from the government relations side, understanding what is motivating people, and then that is helpful in negotiations, because they are more likely to understand what might get everybody to yes.","Their expectations are realistic. Their demands are realistic, and that's what you want when you're in a negotiation.","They tend to be on top of things, so they tend to—they don't tend to be the type that come to you last minute and say, \"Well, we're just seeing this bill now,\" so that's helpful. It's very irritating when groups come to you at the last minute after a bill has been in place for a couple of months, and then they say, \"Well, we didn't know this was here, so stop everything until we can review it,\" so that's helpful that they do tend to get things to you early if they have concerns. It's not always difficult to—when you've been working with policy for a while, you can tend to look at a bill and understand who's going to like it and who's not going to like it, so from that standpoint, I can pretty much identify whether or not the Healthcare Association will have any issues with the bill, just by reading it myself. It’s not very hard to predict.","It does. I mean, everybody's position matters. The healthcare system is a very complex, complicated industry with a lot of moving parts and a lot of interested parties. It's always helpful to know where everybody is and how that guides me to a decision I make. I can't guarantee that we'll always end up on the same page, myself, and any one particular interest group within the healthcare industry, but you certainly want to know where everybody is and—before you really move forward with something you want to know what everybody's thoughts are and how certain legislation's going to impact them, and then you make your decision—as a policymaker, you make your decision which direction you go based on all the feedback you get.","I mean, they're an important player. I wouldn't say that they're the most important. I also wouldn't dismiss them as saying they're unimportant. They are an important player, but it's one of many folks that need to be at a table when big decisions are being made and need to be heard when big decisions are being made.","I mean, they seem to be on top of things. They seem to know what the issues are. They seem to know what possible solutions are out there, who are a lot of our big challenges, and they seem to be engaged in the process. Nothing's going to sneak by them. This kind of goes back to an earlier answer I gave. I don't see them as—they don't get caught off-guard very much. They seem to know what's happening and where things are headed.","With me, no. I mean, I don't think so. I'm still relatively new. Like I said, I haven't had that moment where you're just really butting heads that can kind of sour relationships where you just have to square off against each other, so I guess, maybe being new as I am, I think I've got a good relationship. I think I have open lines of communication so that they know where I am. I know where they are, and there's no false sense of allegiances or motivations. They know that I'm ultimately going to make the decisions I think's right for the state, and not—even if that isn't necessarily right for the Healthcare Association, and then I know full well that they're going to have to advocate their position as well, but like I said, it hasn't really come to a point of irreconcilable differences over any single issue yet. I'm sure that might happen, depending on how long I do this, but it hasn't yet, so, so far, I think we have a very good relationship and have been able to work with each other where we've had differences and come to agreements on things.","Well, there's a big issue, I think, heading into next year. It's going to be cost containment. The government is, obviously, up against this state financially, and a big driver of our cost is healthcare costs, is Medicaid costs, and healthcare costs for employees. They're going to have to play a big role in that conversation. It's something that's become a priority as a health department. They’re going around talking about ways we can get to better manage these cost increases—these year-over-year cost increases, which are quite high. I think it's something the Governor wants to work on as well, so they're going to have to be a big player in that. I think that's going to be driving the conversation next session, and probably even into 2019, I would imagine.","Well, they need to be able to—I would say there's a couple of things. One is they need to be on top of things, because it goes back to what I said. It's very frustrating to me when you're two-thirds of the way through a process and somebody pops up at the last minute, the day before a hearing, and says, \"Well, I didn't know about this bill and it affects us and we need some time to look it over,\" and it makes me think, well, what have you been doing this whole time? That doesn't happen with them, so they do seem to be on top of things. They tend to get to you early so that they're not throwing a wrench in your system at the last minute. They get it in terms of like what I said about understanding where everybody's coming from, both in the other lobbying groups within the healthcare industry, whether it be doctors or patient advocate groups or insurance companies, and they understand where legislators are coming from and where their individual priorities may be, which is also helpful, so I would say that, ultimately, I do find them to be a productive partner, and like I said, they're not ideology-driven, or they're not absolutists.","I mean, I just think that they’re professionals. At least as far as my interactions with them, they conduct themselves professionally and they're reasonable. I guess, dependable, reasonable, are words I would use to describe them. They’re consistent. That's another word. They don't surprise you very much.","Oh, there you go.","I have. Yes, doing well.","In soccer? Was it (inaudible)?","Everyone in (inaudible) renewed this rivalry.","Yes, right.","All right. I hope so. Thanks, guys.","You too. Bye.","Jeannie","Well, I worked with the Delaware Healthcare Association directly for the past four or five years.  It started with work around palliative care, and they were very instrumental and receptive to my request of getting them engaged and increasing palliative care in this state.","For ACS?","Okay.  I am the Government Relations Director for Delaware for the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network.  The American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network is commonly called ACS CAN as an acronym.  It is the advocacy side of the American Cancer Society.  ","Palliative care.","Palliative, yes.","I was approximately four or five years ago that we started to talk about it, probably four years ago; five years ago sounds too far along.  But, about four years ago, and a little history around palliative care in Delaware is we did not have the strongest palliative care system and offers for patients in the state of Delaware.  It was still pretty new and the hospital systems were gradually coming on board with it, and I thought it would behoove me to go right to the hospital association to see if they could get the buy-in from their hospitals to support palliative care and hopefully implement palliative care into their inpatient settings.","The Palliative Care Advisory Council has representatives from all of the hospital members on this council and our goal is to increase palliative care services in the state of Delaware.  ","Yes, exactly.  That’s why our interest in it because while palliative care is really a quality of life issue, the American Cancer Society feels not only will it improve quality of life through coordinated care, it can also bring down costs.  It can make the stresses less for the patient.  Having that extra layer of support gives everyone more comfort in very challenging situations with chronic disease.","Well, there’s more interest at the inpatient level and the outpatient level for palliative care, and there’s also growing consumer awareness now of palliative care.  I believe that’s all due to some of the work of the Palliative Care Advisory Council.  The Palliative Care Advisory Council, working through the Delaware Healthcare Association can reach out to various stakeholders in the state; the Delaware Health Care Commission, for example, to help move the marble along.  ","Wait a minute.  I’m confused with your question.  You’re asking what the Delaware Healthcare Association did, or the Delaware Health Care Commission did?","Oh, I asked them to go their membership, which is made up primarily of hospital leadership, and asked them if they would be willing to promote and work on and try to increase palliative care in their respective hospitals.  They all came back, apparently, after a Delaware Healthcare Association Board meeting and said, “Yes, we agree to this.” ","Okay.  Yes, because a lot of people hear palliative care and they assume it’s hospice care.  Hospice is a small piece of palliative care, the very end of the line.","Yes, and hospitals do it in various ways.  If you—some hospitals will enter people into palliative care maybe the last six months of life.  Other hospitals may enter people in palliative care for the last 15 years of life, or forever.  Especially the pediatric hospitals.  The have palliative care services for families that can go on for years and years and years and years.","I think it’s always helpful—I’ve been the Government Relations Director for Delaware, and candidly, I don’t have an MPH; I wish I did, but I don’t.  I have policy briefs coming to me from the Cancer lens and from the view of the cancer patient, so it’s always helpful to have  with other healthcare stakeholders in the state that can give you their perspective and tell you through the hospital lens, for example, how this is going to impact patients.  That’s always incredibly helpful, and I think I have that with DEHA.  They’re always very transparent with where they are on issues and even though we may not support specific issues or engage in certain issues where they would and we might or vice versa, there’s always a conversation that’s easily had, so that’s good.  That’s huge to know where the hospitals stand.  ","That I see?","I think they do represent the interests of the hospitals very well in the state.  At least when I see them in Legislative Hall, the lobbying interests seem to be done well.  They are up to date and have a voice at the table on important issues, and sometimes lead important issues.","I can’t say that.  I think that they do a good job representing the interests of the hospital systems.  Again, I’ve only—my exposure is all through palliative care and then through issues that I see at Legislative Hall, and I always see them on top of the game doing what they need to do for hospitals.  ","What makes sort of valuable strategic partner?  I can only speak from my lens, which is going to be government relations and legislation and regulatory issues, and obviously the more voices that you have at the table agreeing and advocating on a certain issue, the better it will be.  It’s kind of that simple, as you can imagine.  That’s whether it’s with the Delaware Healthcare Association or other coalitions within the states.  We work with American Lung, American Heart, and I think in Legislative Hall we’re affectionately—I’ll be generous here—known as the body parts coalition.  ","We work on tobacco issues.  We work on healthcare issues, the various health issues as seen from a patient perspective.","I hope I’m helping you because I really—I’m not one of their member organizations, so.","What you’re looking for?  Okay.","Oh good, okay.  ","Well, again, the hospital lens and the patient lens sometimes are similar, and other times are not as similar and that we might not engage as strongly as like a DEHA would.  DEHA is leading things that we would probably be standing on the sidelines and watching, just to make sure our interests—if that makes sense.  ","Well, I think from what I see they are.  When it comes to working, for example, on healthcare benchmarks that the State wants to create, they—from what I see, they are leading that from the hospital provider perspective.  From my sense, you don’t know what you don’t know.  I don’t know what else that they’re working on to say whether they’re leading it or not.  The things that I see them leading on, or I think should be leading on, they are.  ","I know they …","I know they’ve done some programmatic stuff with the American Heart Association and the Million Hearts campaign.  See, we weren’t directly involved with that, but I know that they were very active and engaging all their hospitals with the Million Hearts campaign.  Did they tell you about that?","Oh, okay.  That’s the American Heart Association and I think Christiana Care’s initiative.  ","Again, I don’t know.  I wasn’t directly involved so I can’t speak to it, but it seemed like they were a frontrunner in trying to promote the Million Hearts campaign, and get people engaged with it, at all levels.","Not that I’m aware of.  ","There’s been issues where we haven’t taken—I mean, I guess the Caregiver Act, which happened a couple of years ago, which the hospital had some reservations with, ACS supported in the broadest sense, but I’ll be honest, we—we’re not working that bill that hard.  It wasn’t our bill but we certainly supported it.  I believe the bill was modified from suggestions—using suggestions from both sides.","I think in a perfect world it would be great if I can get agreement within Health and Social Services to codify like a palliative care advisory council; to have DEHA’s support in that, that would be great.  That’s something that hasn’t happened yet and I don’t know whether it will ever happen.  It’s kind of—if it’s going to be housed within the Delaware state government, obviously I have to get their sign-off first, and I haven’t done that yet, so there’s some pieces that have to happen but in a perfect world hopefully that will happen and DEHA will agree to get behind codifying the Palliative Care Advisory Council.  At that point, it may not be housed in DEHA anymore.  I mean, but it would—I think we’d all still have active representation on the council.","I don’t think so.  I appreciate working with them.","Primarily with Lisa, Lisa Schieffert, who is our Director of policy.  I’m not sure what here official title is.","She is.  Most of my contact is with Lisa.  ","However, I wouldn’t hesitate to reach out to Wayne too if I had a question.","Oh, geez.  ","It would have to be a very smart person, a savvy person.  A well-rounded person that understands the Delaware environment and the universal healthcare environment.  I think that’s it.","Well, the benchmarks, whatever is happening there.  As far as I can see, nothing definitive has actually happened yet.  Then obviously, too, if something goes on at the federal level, that might need advocacy action.","Healthcare, repeal and replace.","That type of thing, yes.","Okay.  Well, thank you.  ","You too.  Bye-bye.","Mark Thompson","Yes. I’m the Executive Director of the Medical Society of Delaware.","Thank you.","Going well. So far, so good. Fortunately I was with the organization a little over six years before being named the new Executive Director so I had some familiarity, a little bit of familiarity with the organization and the role, so that helped quite a bit.","Yes, I was the external affairs officer responsible for all public and media relations, community relations or community outreach initiatives, as well as government affairs and, let’s see, would also support the rest of the organization in terms of any type of marketing or communications type strategies.","Let’s see. In terms of my current tenure, I’ve actually had, going back to, let’s see, at least 1999, I’ve had multiple interaction with the Delaware Healthcare Association. Prior to working with the Medical Society of Delaware I was at two member hospitals of the Delaware Healthcare Association and worked closely with current—I guess Wayne is the, what? The President and CEO?","Worked with him as well as his predecessor. It goes back a number of years.","I believe we’ve worked well together. We’ve particularly again in the areas of—primary issues particularly with healthcare these days always seem to have to deal of the legislative and regulatory front, particularly at the State level, and those seem to be where there’s a lot of issues of common overlap. ","Sure. Let’s see, over the last—let’s see. We’ve had a few where we certainly have worked—I’m trying to think there was greater collaboration; issues around, legislative issues around physician assisted suicide, legalization of recreational marijuana, expansion of use for medical marijuana. Also in the area of dealing with trying to address pre-authorizations on the needs of physicians and providers. Certainly, those have been just a few just over the past year or so.","At least in terms of providing that greater sense of collaboration and continuity for all the hospitals. Being able to come to—when I was in the hospitals, being able to have a central point of contact within the DHA to then be able to begin to develop a unified position on matters, so that has always helped. Then, always having access to particular—both the present CEO as well as the staff, being able to within the Medical Society to be able to reach out and say, or to ask questions: where are your positions? What are your positions on certain issues? How are you folks attacking these issues, or addressing them? Just, again, that broad sense of collaboration has really kind of been the hallmark of it, if you will.","Kind of all of the above. Typically, just because schedules are the way that they are, we do phone calls. Certainly email, text, all of the above, but then also we do have—let’s see. We have monthly leadership meetings kind of within that and it’s where we meet for breakfast with myself, Wayne Smith, the current President and CEO, as well as the President of the Delaware State Chamber of Commerce and as well as the head of Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield of Delaware and we will ask—we’ll be able to have a good honest dialogue about issues, positions and exchange of ideas. So, we really do it in multiple channels because of based on the relationship.","That it is the body that represents the hospitals in the state of Delaware. I mean that is first and foremost what comes to my mind is it is the trade—it’s the organization representing all the hospitals, bottom line.","Kind of looking from the outside as an external stakeholder?","You know, that’s a great question. They are a very solid organization; they always have been. I guess if I could maybe one area that I’d love to be included in some of their communications that they do send to the members of their organization. I know I used to get—when I worked in the hospitals, they sent out a weekly e-newsletter and as kind of a fellow collaborator, fellow stakeholder, though not a member of that organization, I’d love to be able to get their newsletter that they send to the hospitals.","Yeah, I think it’s to those things you just mentioned but also what are some of the issues that are really key and critical to the hospitals? What are some of the big issues that are happening within each hospital that might be communicated? A big part of that is we do have members, it’s a medical society, who are employed positions within those hospitals and as we even attempt to recruit physicians who are employed in those hospitals, the issues that are first and foremost to them may also be helpful to us as well.","That’s actually a great question. Again, I’ll go with the willingness to collaborate, from my standpoint, as being informational. Someone where there’s a one-stop shop of knowledge and information on critical issues where they are a legitimate, credible resource. That’s also really important. I think that’s probably one of the main things is that they are a highly trusted, credible resource.","There’s a few different ways. The organization does a tremendous amount of work. I think there’s that level of trust, trust is key. In a small state like Delaware there are no six degrees of separation so when folks give you their word on things you know you can count on that. You know that you can take it to the bank and so that plays to that credibility. There’s, again, that level of respect where not only are they highly respected but also they do provide mutual respect in return.","Yes.","Absolutely. I have not had—personally, in my years of dealing with them, I’m never had to go back and say, “What did you do?” or, “You told me you were going to do X but you did Y. What’s up with that?” I’ve never had that issue. They say they’re going to deliver on something, they deliver on it, and when they partner on something, they partner on something and I know it’s a good relationship.","Kind of even within that. There may be times that we may not always agree and that’s okay, but at least there’s that mutual understanding of why we both have the positions that we do. Given my organization, I represent physicians. They represent the hospitals. On the majority of issues, high level, we have the same position on things, but at the end of the day I understand what hospital administration has to do is very different than that of where the practice of medicine for the physicians, for where my members fall. But we are able to, in a very congenial, professional way, to have that honest dialogue and that we can still agree to disagree but yet we know that at the end of the day we’re still after the same common issue, many times. There’s going to be another issue and we know we can trust each other and go from there. I hope that kind of makes sense.","I think so. This was before I assumed my position. I’m trying to think of one—there’s one that’s actually, I can give you one right now but it’s kind of in the works. I can give you that one if you want.","If you’re interested in kind of a current one. It’s the issue of there’s a concept of what’s called maintenance of certification for physicians, and we are not necessarily of the same view of that concept. It has to do with certification and board maintenance for our physicians. One of the key things where Wayne Smith and I, what we understand is we both are the conduits of our respective organizations. We’re the respective conduits; I’m from my board and he is the same for his board. We keep it in perspective, and it’s—we don’t take it personally and that’s the thing. We had this very conversation today and they were—quite honestly, we are looking at potentially going—there’s some things we may look at from a legislative perspective approach. He would prefer that we not do that, but the thing is, we said, “Well, let’s get our boards together and let’s make sure that they talk and figure out a good outcome. Nobody wants to kind of go nuclear if we don’t have to, but if we can get our boards together and talk then let’s do that.” ","You know, I think they are central to it but same as the Medical Society, because, again, representing the perspective of the physicians. It’s paramount that if anything is going to have to happen in the state then you’re going to have to literally work with the appropriate stakeholders and DHA is actually—if you’re going to be doing something related to or with or for or by the hospitals, it’s paramount that they’re central to the discussion.","No, I think they play the appropriate role as it is. I think when there have been times where they need—what has been in their best interest, to step out and lead, they have. But when it’s also been appropriate to form a collaborative base, they have. Being a collaborator on that—let me give you an example.","Yes, there’s one. There’s an issue before the State right now and that is, it’s referred to as the Healthcare Benchmark Spending, where the State is looking at benchmarking spending and keeping it—capping at a certain level. This is an initiative that is being launch by the new Secretary of Health and Social Services. It potentially is going to really alter the landscape of reimbursement payments, value-based and risk arrangements, access to care, how care is funded and reimbursed. This is an issue that’s not just going to touch hospitals. It’s going to touch the hospitals. It’s going to touch the physicians. It’s going to touch the payers. It’s going to touch state employees. It’s going to touch Medicaid recipients. It’s going to touch everybody and this is one where it’s a perfect opportunity as this process develops, to stand shoulder to shoulder, and work with not just the State on what it’s trying to make happen, but with the other partners, the other stakeholders and the other potentially affected groups.","It is probably, in addition to some of those legislative issues I just mentioned between marijuana, physician-assisted suicide, those are all very important issues because they really kind of get to professional moral and ethical issues, but this one is probably going to be the single largest issue that we face in at least the next months, maybe a year or longer. ","That’s a great question and I will pull no punches on this one since you’re giving me the opportunity. First of all, again, I’ll reiterate I think the team there at the Healthcare Association, they’re phenomenal, they’re excellent and that’s from everybody who works there. But in terms of being able to work with my organization, part of my organization, I have an insurance subsidiary where we can provide not just medical liability insurance but full cross-the-line health and personal lines of assurance to the hospitals, to their employees, their staff, and I would really—I’d love for the Delaware Healthcare Association to be able to open that door and opportunity where they can actually become a Class B stockholder within this corporation. So, at least allow my insurance subsidiary the opportunity to quote business for all of their members. That’s one.","I hope that doesn’t sound too self-serving, but you asked.","Because both of those would be mutually beneficial. It’s not just something that’s going to benefit the Medical Society. It actually could potentially be real cost savings to the hospitals and the Association could receive dividends as part of this insurance collaborative that we could do. So they would get a return on it in addition to potentially lower rates for, like I said, personal lines, for all benefits associated for their individual members.","Okay. Well, let’s see. At least you didn’t give me the animal. I was expecting the animal. What would be the attributes of that person?","No, that’s okay. I’m actually glad it’s a person and not an animal. I’ve kind of gone through those. They are someone who is trustworthy. They’re someone who is knowledgeable about what they speak, and if they don’t know the answers they’re going to tell you that, so again, there’s that level of honesty. They’re candid, and you know, again, I don’t want to try to overuse the word but they’re collaborative. Those are kind of the first, initial words. It’s like if you’re a person and what are those attributes, those are the first attributes that come to my mind. ","I hope that helps.","Yes.","My pleasure. Certainly, if it’s appropriate, pass on that I think it’s a very wise thing that they’re doing with this and so kudos to them and their board and the organization for doing this. I think it’s very smart.","Thanks a lot. You, too. Will you be at liberty to share any parts of the report with folks like myself who’ve been able to participate. I understand if not because I realize what the process is, but just asking.","Yeah, I mean if it’s appropriate. I know that it may not be but I just was curious.","Okay.","It’s actually this upcoming Monday.","I’ll see him at 7:30 Monday morning.","Very good. Hey, thank you, gentlemen, and have a great weekend.","Thanks. Bye-bye.","Michelle Taylor","Michelle Taylor with the United Way of Delaware, President and Chief Executive Officer. I’ve been with United Way of Delaware for 18 years.","It really started through Dr. Bob Laskowski, who was our previous Board Chair, and so maybe that was about 10 years ago. Dr. Bob Laskowski was always good at helping me figure out, right—our work, we focus on three things that were really top, out-front, right, education, income and health.","In health, that’s from babies born healthy, all the way from cradle-to-grave. Particularly did a lot in, I would say, in providing resources around both physical and mental health and then over time, trying to figure out how do we work it with public health in Delaware? How do we really get some of the social determinants to get better outcomes and so Dr. Bob Laskowski is a good connector and made me aware of the organization. Periodically, because all of the hospital CEOs were around the table, from time to time, it gave me kind of this captive audience for state-wide organizations to kind of come in and share information about what we were doing. But it sometimes made, if there was an (inaudible) or opportunity to better work with the hospitals, right, as healthcare providers.","I would say, quite frankly, it’s been a long time since I’ve done that, probably not since Dr. Bob has left. But in that process—and next is Celine Smith (phon) who is a great—his background around advocacy and so we started getting into advocacy and public policy things so he joined our Board, so then Wayne joined out Board. But we probably leverage him more on just tapping into his advocacy skills, his connections to Delaware, his strategic thinking as a thought leader, but we probably have not really leveraged the organization.","Yes.","Yes, it’s been a while. I’ve got to think about what we might have been doing. At one point, we had started something called Healthy Delawareans, an initiative trying to get the providers around the table. We had our own area where we had health providers, federally qualified medical homes, what do you say, community workers, like various people from community centers around the table, all really trying to work on a collective health strategy. At the time, I think this was when it was Doctor (inaudible), no—that’s with—I can’t remember who the predecessor was for the (inaudible), so some of the players were different. Where, it gave me—it gave me one-stop to be able to just try—to try to get them to see more of the community’s perspective and to brainstorm, somewhat, around opportunities to better collaborate.","No, so—that’s a great question. We used to say education, income, and health and some United Ways still do that. We’ve embedded health, so health isn’t a standout, it’s kind of a given, it’s a core foundation for people, so we want babies born healthy, we want—in order for kids to read, health is embedded. They have—I just left Christiana Care Hospital, right before I talked to you, we were talking about opportunities and synergies. The fact that babies have to be born healthy, they have to have access to resources, physically, mentally, cognitively, socially, emotionally, all of those things, early interventions, not meeting their developmental milestones, connecting them to resources and home visits, those types of things. They’re all embedded in what we do now.","Yes, it cuts across all of them.","But more heavily—I can tell you, it’s more heavily focused in the youth space.","Although it cuts across all, right, and we still provide resources and funding, particularly more for mental behavior health services, really diving into the place of trauma, and (inaudible) and diverse childhood experiences. We’re trying to understand stuff from a health perspective, brain perspective, science perspective, and how does that relate and play out particularly for people, children and adults in poverty.","I want to be honest; I don’t know if people know there really is a Delaware Healthcare Association. What they’re known—I know that they make up the CEOs of the hospitals, and I know they’re meeting to try to figure out how to collaborate, but I don’t think that my team knows that. I don’t even know, quite honestly, if you were to ask my Board members what does Wayne’s organization do; I don’t think people know. They tend to sit at the table separate, not together, so either we’re partnering with Christian or (inaudible), or if (inaudible), but in my lane, in all the community work I’m doing, they wouldn’t necessarily be a known brand.","The Delaware Healthcare Association?","Yes, yes. My Board is made up of corporate CEOs, community stakeholders, statewide—it’s a 36-37 member board, but I would say definitely C-suite individuals that I would think are in relevant places in the community.","Honestly, I can’t think of one.","I’ve been on a lot of Boards and Commissions, not in any circle that I’ve been in, their name is not listed as a partner.","No, that’s why I’m saying the individual organizations that make it up, I think the names are there, the brands are there, but I don’t necessarily see the name of the Delaware Healthcare. ","Common aspirations is at the top of it, people who have common aspirations in the sense that, one, we want to work for the common good so on the whole, as most of our collaborations are planned out. People ultimately pay to play, so that they—they’re actually putting some skin in the game and this is not necessarily financial resources, but I’m talking about they’re bringing in their talent to the table that’s active and engaged and helping to work on the collective solutions. Those that really want to look for real synergies and drives the community outcomes, like words that are resolve-oriented, and actually around resolve-oriented, there’s been a lot of talk about how do we really get the collective outcomes.","Well, generally, I think we deal with the lagging, the big thing that we want to decrease or increase, which is sometimes a big lofty thing. But then the group, generally, all the collaborations or commissions I serve on, then we try to work for something that’s more tangible, that would be a leading outcome or metric. We’re trying to get away from lofty but trying to work to get specific, right.","Sorry; I should add, too, that in some cases the stakeholders are coming around actually to create or change infrastructure.","But it was still to be defined, right, within an outcome or metric.","I mean, honestly, I can’t say that I’ve seen them—the issues are way too big for any one sector or industry to be able to do alone. I don’t necessarily see the group at the table on a lot of the collaborative issues that are happening in the state as it relates to health. Or even the indirect things, like the hospitals and their community needs assessments, are looking at social determinants or trying to reduce the violence or working on whatever their three to four things are. They’re generally at the table, either creating a table for others to be at, or they’re at the table where collaboration already exists to try to work and drive those, that change. Maybe they need to be wearing two hats.","No, (inaudible), Christian’s leading something or—I’m just making this up, Nomora (phon) or whoever, there may be an opportunity for them to lead it more under Delaware Healthcare Association than it is just under their individual hospitals, if there really is alignment and synergy amongst the hospitals.","You see what I’m saying? They’re doing it individually, they’re wearing their own hats, but if we’re all working—if we’re all in agreement that, here’s what the hospital systems in Delaware is going to work on, I don’t know when they come to the table and someone’s holding a meeting, they’re doing it in the name of the Delaware Healthcare Association, you know what I’m saying? To me, if they did that, that would kind of speak to all the hospital systems are united, this is a collaboration between them already, so it’s a bigger force behind the work than just the entity alone.","I’ve never really—I haven’t ever witnessed it where it was—not of late anyway. Where they’re coming and where they’re actually united on a thing together; I’ve only seen it separate, and still as separate to me, I think Christian is very effective in what they do. They’re the main provider in New Castle County. We only have one major healthcare system, one major, right. (Inaudible) is for kids and St. Francis, they are the big entity on the block. When we have them at the table, we feel like we got all the healthcare systems. ","I can work through any one of the Chiefs and now, if they’re willing—if they buy into it, they’re willing to take it back to the rest of the Chiefs to get their pulse to see, is this doable? Not doable? Something we can do across the state so that we can do it for the whole county and we can do it easily by working through the network that they’ve created.","Yes, I mean, for our organization, I think there’s opportunity just with being a brain trust, a thought leader around, we’re all trying to solve the same problems. Instead of me just brainstorming with Christian which I just did, how powerful could it be if I brainstormed with the whole group at one time? Because it’s a statewide problem, it’s not just a (inaudible) County problem.","I mean, yes, I think it can start with Wayne, or whoever his team is because he’s kind of the face of the organization. I don’t know, I never really understood quite honestly, who’s his customer? If his core customer is providing support to the CEOs and trying to make sure that their needs are being met, then we’re less of his audience. If the idea is to get some synergy and alignment amongst them collectively and figure out how they can be a greater force around things to help to drive and shape change in Delaware, than I think that could be coordinated through him. Because it’s kind of like, to some degree, he’s a vetting source, to figure out what might work because he knows the CEOs, he has the best relationship with them. How would we—based upon their agenda, first of all just sharing information, letting people know, look, we’re here; here’s our mission, here’s what we’re working on, and here’s our top priorities in the space we’re in so that other people may know when there’s an opportunity to partner or align, they come to mind.","No, I don’t have one.","Wayne and I have different personal views on stuff, but not the organization.","That’s not a bad thing, it’s just a different perspective on how organizations create change, and how.","Again, I think that if there is a joint force that they came up with, some alignment, and people knowing it, I think that it could be a bigger support asset to the community as a whole. But I do think, and I mean, I don’t know if you polled the members, but when do they ever talk about the Delaware Healthcare Association versus just talking about their own individual hospitals, and/or what things have they collectively agreed that they’re marching to the same beat and they’re using the same sheet of music? In my world, I’ve got to try to get the community, a lot of times, all singing the same song, all to the same beat, and so I haven’t been in many settings—oh, I know one that they all did or they did something like health equity.","Yes, so it was around the LGBTQ work, where every hospital signed on, and I can’t remember, but Christian, I think, and maybe someone else, there was some healthcare certification or award they give for (inaudible). But what we did is, all of them signed up to be advocates for health equity around the LGBTQ and there’s like a week or month that it’s highlighted and that meant all of them have provided training to their physicians and their citizen healthcare workers just around the issue of equity as it relates to the LGBTQ community and their commitment to diversity and inclusion. There was some training on how they operate direct for the patients. There was a whole ad that we took out in the paper in combination with a Pride group, around congratulating all of our hospitals for doing this.","Mm-hmm?","You think that’s a fun question? That’s a hard question here.","Hopefully it would be engaging, collaborative, educational, thought leaders; those are the ones that come top of mind.","Again, I think they’re doing it individually.","They have to figure out how to do it collectively. I think they’re phenomenal thought leaders as individual entities. I just don’t know if the brand carries over when they talk about or think about collective.","No, no problem. Hopefully I was helpful.","Have a great day.","Bye-bye.","Molly","Molly: Sure.  I'm the Deputy Secretary and part of my portfolio includes policy development, as well as interacting with the legislature and stakeholder entities such as DHA.","Molly: In my previous position, I was the State Director for then-Congressman, now-Governor John Carney, so I had previously reached out to and attempted to work with DHA on—both as a way to touch base, but then specifically around the Ebola scare back in 2014—yes, 2014, where there was a lot of consternation around what the states are doing and individual health systems, and then there was a lot of discussion at the Federal level around what mandates the Federal government should be putting in place.","Molly: I think we've had a good—I can obviously only speak with direct knowledge of the time that I've been here, but from the previous Administration, I mean, my understanding is they've always been a thought partner.  Obviously we're a small state and it's easy to reach out to CEOs individually, but we also understand that they're busy, so it's very helpful to have a resource where we can talk to either Wayne or Lisa Schieffert, or somebody else there and say, hey, really quick, do you have 10 minutes to tell me what your members, or any information you have about this particular topic?","Molly: Sure.  They—obviously, they're dialoguing regularly with both their other either hospital or healthcare associations around the country, and so they are bringing a very—not only a Delaware perspective but a national perspective to issues that we're facing here in Delaware, especially with the state and travel bans and all this other stuff, I think it's helpful to have that national perspective and to hear it directly.","Molly: It's, again, I think, very helpful when we're considering these things, to take many different perspectives into account and to have an entity that, again, is very plugged in and regularly dialoguing with not only hospitals in Delaware, but again, colleagues around the country.  It just brings a helpful perspective to the conversation.","Molly: Sure, and I think, again, the nice thing about Delaware is that you can get everybody in a room.  One of their strengths is that, when they have a meeting, they're getting regular input and feedback from the CEOs, so it's not—it's an organization that is directly in touch with its members in, I guess, the most significant—I don't know how much more of a significant buy-in you can get than having a health system CEO at the table as you're developing, as you're having conversations and thinking through strategies.","Molly: Obviously trust is a huge factor.  Does someone do what they say and say what they're going to do?  Is there a level of trust and predictability to the relationship, is there a willingness to be upfront and transparent around, hey, we don't agree with you on this; we're still going to have a collegial relationship but we're not with you on this issue.","Molly: I do.  I mean, I think there's always a challenge because there's things that obviously have to stay proprietary to a group, but I have yet to experience—I mean, I've only been here eight months and I'm not aware of some of the anecdotal experiences from other people, I'm not aware of an instance where DHA has not been forthcoming about where they are for better or for worse.  I mean, they may disagree with us, but they've said, hey, this is what we're doing.","Molly: I would rate them highly in each of those three categories.","Molly: Sure.  There was a piece of legislation that was being sponsored by the majority leader of the Delaware House of Representatives.  I guess disagree would be too strong; we were agnostic on the issue, but DHA felt very strongly against the issue.  We just had a frank discussion; this is where we are, we represent the Administration, the Administration has asked us to take a particular stance.  Talking to Wayne Smith, he said, okay, well, on behalf of some of my members, we don't agree with this piece of legislation.  We were hoping that you would be aligned with us to lobby against it, but we understand that you're not.  I don't think that's the best decision, this is why we're making our decision; okay, agree to disagree.","Molly: I think they have been a strong partner.  Where it does get a little bit challenging is just, it's a consensus organization.  Obviously, they represent health systems in various states, so they have people like Christiana Care that are well-funded and robust and have a diverse mix of payers, so they've got Medicaid clients, Medicare clients, people with private insurance.","Molly: I mean, I think one of the challenges that's just inherent in all Delaware organizations, including us as the state government, is just there's a reticence to be bold or innovative.  We have a lot of the—oh, we tried that 10 years ago, or, oh, we're already doing that.  There tends to be some dismissiveness around innovations or changes or ideas, so I think what would be really helpful—because we've been having a conversation around healthcare innovation and pay for value and all of these concepts that are really taking flight in other states but haven't really moved off the ground here in Delaware, it would just be really great if the Healthcare Association and the hospitals could take more ownership over that space.","Molly: Sure.  I mean, again, it would be great to see them continue to be supportive of the effort.  They have—we are having healthcare summits where people are being brought in from other states and places to talk about what they've done and what we think we could do here in Delaware.  Maybe not exactly what they're doing somewhere else, but some version thereof.  They've served as a convener, they've served as a public and vocal advocate for the benchmark, so that is definitely—appreciated is an understatement.  It's hugely helpful, I think, for them to take that role.","Molly: Wait, I'm sorry, say that again?","Molly: Yes, I think you see pockets of it in places, so you see—the example of Kaiser Permanente, they have been able to realign care.  You're seeing pockets of it in Vermont.  You're seeing some forward progress in Massachusetts.  These are all places that DHA is aware of and that we've have conversations with them around.","Molly: Sorry, I just—I keep getting these random emails from the Secretary that I'm trying to make sure there's not something urgent.  Would you mind repeating that last question?  I heard the part of going into 2018.","Molly: The biggest—yes, I'm sure there's things that I'm not even thinking about, but they probably are, so I think we just appreciate the ongoing, open and productive relationship around everything.  The biggest priority for us is going to be the benchmark, but I think the other big thing is we have an opiate crisis in Delaware and trying to think of ways that we can help emergency departments use moments like overdose and encounters within the health systems to attempt to get people into appropriate treatment for their substance use disorder.  It is definitely an opportunity, and I think it's something with the health systems and even EMP struggle with is, how are we helping these people?","Molly: Oh, that's an excellent question.  The funny thing is, you say that and the first thing that pops into my mind is Wayne Smith.  I don't know if that's good, bad or indifferent, but I just—I so associate him with DHA.  But I mean, he's knowledgeable, he's well-connected, he's not shy about sharing an opinion, but he's also, again, a very collegial and straightforward person.","Molly: Okay, no problem.  Good luck with all your work.","Peter Schwartzkopf","Well I’ve been here for 16 years, Speaker for going on six years now, and my contact has always been through Wayne or through Jeff Fried and local contacts from Beebe hospital type thing, so pretty much that’s what my—and I don’t know exactly how long we’re talking about, but—now I’m trying to think, when Wayne went to you guys, that’s back in—it’s probably what, 2006, ’7, somewhere in there?","I don’t know. Anyway, I know Wayne from being here, he was a legislator before he went to you guys, or to the Health Commission. So, I’ve known him for a while, and again have good relationship with him, and good relationship with Jeff Fried, and we meet periodically for breakfast and discuss some of the issues and that type of thing, so. It’s been a while. I don’t know how many years, but it’s been since I—I’m definitely more involved since I became Speaker.","I keep—I forget—I’m not talking to some​body that knows that much about where we are. I am—yes, I represent the area that Beebe hospital is in.","So actually, that’s not true. I represent the area that puts a lot of people in Beebe hospital. The hospital is actually right on the other side, just a little bit outside of my district.","(Inaudible) I do have a medical center in my district.","No, we’re good.","Because we do not want to touch and move that phone again.","Well, I mean I’m a retired cop. So, I don’t know an awful lot about some of the issues, and that’s what we rely on different people around here to help us when issues come up, we—and that’s the role of the lobbyist that is played in this building, and where some people may have a negative connotation about lobbyists I don’t, there’s good lobbyists and there’s some not so good. But I look at those, the people that represent groups and organizations, as being an information source. So, when some​thing comes up that I’m not 100% sure on, I try to find out who represents the agency or who represents the organization, and set up a meeting with them and try to get as much—pick their brains, basically, for as much as I can, for whatever I need. In this particular case, any time it comes up with Health Commission issues or whatever, Wayne’s my guy that I would call first and talk to. I have very good relationship with Jeff Fried from Beebe Hospital.","That’s why—and they’re the ones that host—they have the periodic, I think it’s like quarterly meetings that we do in the morning. I’m all about breakfast, so they know that if there’s a breakfast I’ll probably be there more likely, so. They host all the Sussex County Representatives to talk about issues that affect the hospital and the health care industry, and they answer any questions we may have about what they do and why they do what they do.","No, it’s—it actually started I believe before I was Speaker, as majority leader. It started—I don’t know who set it up or how it got started, I really don’t remember that part, but it had to have come from one of the two of those two guys that I just talked about, I would think. But it’s some​thing that’s a good resource for all of us here, or at least the ones in Sussex County. I don’t know whether they do it elsewhere; I would imagine they do; I don’t …","They don’t? Really?","There’s—well, count the Senators, there’s 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 …","Yes. There’s 13, I think, total legislators from Sussex County, and most times we get probably three quarters of the people show up. There’s only like one or two that miss. We all have other things going on, too, so. But they do them early in the morning and every​body can hit that before they go somewhere else.","But it’s also a good avenue for us to—for me as a leader at the time and Speaker now, it’s also a good avenue for me to see where—let me put on a political hat first, okay? So, with the political hat, I’m the only Democrat legislator in Sussex County. The rest of them are all Republicans, so as the leader of the House it’s very interesting and important for me to attend these meetings, so that when things are discussed I can get a sense of where they are, if there’s pending legislation or some​thing like that coming out. So, it really is important for me anyway, in that sense as well, because if some​thing comes up or if I talk about some​thing and I get opposition from some of the other legislators, I know right away that I have to do a better job of trying to educate them to come around to my way of thinking or whatever. Also, when they bring up issues or when Wayne talks about things that are impacting the health profession or whatever, it’s nice to hear what some of the others are thinking as well. So, for me it’s a win all the way around.","Shoot, I’m just trying to think. ","It’s been—I missed the very last meeting, I was out of town. So I don’t know what the most recent things are but, and I’m trying to think, I mean, we had—I mean this goes, as far as I can remember, this goes as far back as when we had the case of Doctor Bradley down here, who was molesting kids, and it was probably the biggest serial child molester in probably the country’s history, and Beebe was right in the middle of it, and I do remember that part of it, and we were all called together to talk to them about what happened and every​thing like that, so, I mean it was a ready-made avenue for us to all communicate about some​thing really tragic that was happening in our area. But I mean from time to time they have different issues. For the life of me I can’t think of any​thing we talked about lately, because I missed the last meeting.","Yes, I mean Wayne always briefs us on pending legislation they might be requesting, he briefs us on legislation that’s occurring in other States, things that are happening across the country. He warns us of things some​times that we should be aware of so we can be educated and take a stand one way or the other on. I mean obviously there’s a lot of questions when it comes to the rising costs of health care, and recently I’ve been dealing and talking to them about that and some of the practices in State hospitals and stuff like that about pricing, but it’s just a good resource for us.","I’m just sitting here looking at Lauren, we’re like, no​body’s ever asked me that, so what I think it best represents, but for me it best represents a conduit to the information I need to do my job, and do it in a very productive way. They’re ready and a steady resource for me. It goes both ways, I mean, if there are questions in the industry, I know exactly who to talk to. They know exactly who to call if they need help for—to do some of the things that they do. So, I don’t know how to answer that other than that way.","The communication is really good. That for me is important. The ability to pick a phone up and know who to call and know that it’s—what I’m concerned about is going to be taken seriously, so. I mean my job’s all about relationships, building friendships, relationships and getting things done, because that’s how you move forward around this building. In the area of health care, and every​thing that’s about health care nowadays, as much as it’s really grown and especially in my area with the senior citizen population exploding, it’s very important to have that ability and the communication. So any​thing else that comes is just an added bonus. So, for me the best thing that I have going for me with you guys or with the Commission is the communication and the education that goes back both ways.","I’m surprised to learn that they aren’t doing these type meetings up​state. I don’t know whether—I mean obviously it helps to get the leadership on board when you need things done, but it also helps the leadership if they get things done with other areas of the State. Communication is key; education is valuable; so the more legislators that are educated in that field—now I don’t know what they’re doing on other areas, I was …","Yes. I would—it would be helpful to me if every​body had the access to information flowing in both directions as I—as we do down here in Sussex.","I think they’ve—I don’t know. I really don’t know. When it comes to impacting or effecting change, is that what you’re asking? Or …","Oh, I think they’re a major part of the discussion. At least for me they are, because whenever there is an issue that’s the first place I go. I mean, the first call I make is to Wayne or Jeff. I have, like I say, I have a good relationship with both of them. I know them both to be—they’ll tell me what they're thinking and whether it’s productive or not, so—or helpful to me or not. I mean it’s a big factor in this building is trust and verifying information, so for me it’s—I don’t know. I think they play a huge part. Let’s put it this way. They’re a resource that’s available any time I need them, and that’s important.","If there’s any​thing that I would say is a little bit of a negative, they’re in possession of a lot more information and knowledge about some of the things that—if I call and ask questions, I get my answers, then we have a discussion, but there may be some times when there’s some information out there that, unless I ask the question, I’m not going to get it, if that makes any sense. Wayne’s in and out of the building, we sit down, we have conversations; he’s not hiding any​thing from me, but if I’m not privy to the right questions, I might not get all the information I need. So, the only thing I would think is that there is a lot of information that is out there that could be helpful, but if I’m not smart enough to figure out what the questions are—it’s not his job, I’m not saying that, it’s not his job to keep me briefed and informed on every​thing, but if I don’t know the question it’s kind of—or the whole issue, it’s hard to figure out the question, but, I mean with Wayne it’s just like sitting down and having the discussion and it goes where I need it to go, so. I can’t even say that’s a negative, I’m just saying that you guys—the Commission is in possession of a lot of information that could possibly be helpful, if I knew the right questions to ask.","Well they’re more or less the experts in that field, so, where I’m a novice. But (inaudible) I can tell you, if half the problems in health care were as easy to fix as what people think they are, they’d be fixed by now.","I’m trying to figure out how to explain what I do. So, if you think of it more like a spider​web, and I’ve got like leads going in other areas, police and education and the one on the right side is leading to health care, that’s what I’m talking about over there, but I just use the health care commission as a tremendous information source to figure out what I need to know. My whole job isn’t 100% health care.","Where theirs is. It’s not like I’m delving into every​thing, I need to know every​thing there is to know about health care, because I don’t have that much room in my brain. So, I’ve got to—when I need them, they’re there, and when I need them they help me to do what I need to get done.","Yes, the cancer bill …","The position of the hospitals?","Is that what you’re asking?","It’s very important. I mean, I don’t know—all right, so, we have a lot of different people here from a lot of different backgrounds, and very few are coming to us from hospitals. So, we know very little about it except experiences we’ve had by going to hospitals. So, when a hospital—when Jeff Fried calls me, which he very rarely does for some​thing I’m not involved with, so if some​body has a piece of legislation, if he calls me I take that call, because I want to hear his side of what’s going on. I know there’s others that value, in their counties, certain people, I don’t know who they would be, but there—these guys have contacts all over the place. While I don’t know any​body from Christiana Care to get to, except a couple doctors that I’ve had some dealings with, one was on the kidney legislation I was doing because I’m very interested in the gift of life and that type stuff having donated a kidney, and they stepped up with that—in that area, that was years ago though. I don’t know any​body up there, but other people do, and they get calls from different people, and it’s no different than any other aspect of our job, I mean, if we’re doing some​thing on law enforcement I’m getting calls from cops. But I will listen to them because they have more of an idea of what the ramifications of the bill will be. So, I’d be stupid not to listen to a hospital, a CEO of the hospital or president of the hospital, or any person associated with a hospital, if they’re calling about a certain issue or a bill that’s getting ready to go before a committee or some​thing of that nature, I want to know the information. So, when they call, they move right up to the top of the list of my importance.","I mean you’re talking about an industry that consumes over one-third of our budget, in the whole big ball that’s called health care. So, and I know that the Association doesn’t really have that much to do with that side of it, other than they know every​thing that’s going on, but in relation to the Healthcare Association and what they do, they’re the best out there. You guys have all the information and the information we need to make better decisions in this building. I mean it’s hard for some​body who knows very little about the thing to vote yes or no, depending on the bill, when some​body from the Association, or some​body that the Association has asked to come in here and talk to us, comes in and stands in front of us in the committee and said, “This is a bad bill and here’s why,” then we’re given more information, chances are we’re not going to vote it out of committee. So, you’re asking when they get involved or they listen to you, yes absolutely.","Well, we’ve got an issue right now, we’re talking about—we’re trying to see how we can negate the tremendous increase in cost, and one of those cost drivers is the emergency room in hospitals and things like that. We’re trying to get some information on costs from the different hospitals in the State, and obviously this is hitting them in the area they really probably don’t want to be hit, or looked at. But I’ve had conversations, I went down, my chief of staff and I went down and talked to Wayne and Jeff, and discussed what we were trying to do, I’m not trying to blindside any​body or any​thing, and while they obviously are very protective of the hospitals, they were open to have the discussion. So, I mean that’s an example right there of where it’s some​thing that could negatively affect them, but they wanted to try to influence the angle in which we were going by having that conversation with us, so to minimize whatever impact it would be.","If I could wave a magic wand, I wouldn't be having this phone conversation, because I wouldn’t be in this chair. How we could help better facilitate the communication, or value? I don’t know, I got Lauren here, she’s the smartest one in the room, and she’s looking at me funny now, so I’m not sure. I think we have a great relationship as it is. I mean, with—Wayne is a good advocate for you guys, and I’ve got a very good relationship with him, we’re of opposite parties, I can tell you that, he’s a strong political ideologue, he’s a historian buff and every​thing like this, but we don’t let any of that get in the middle of this stuff and I always look forward to our conversations I have with him. I know obviously they’re supposed to be controlling—not controlling; directing any change that comes through with the hospitals and health services and every​thing like that, and I think Wayne knows that he can call me and have that honest conversation, so having—waving a magic wand and making it better, I don’t know what I could do. I don’t know—I mean for me just to know that they’re there and this commission’s there, the Association’s there to take my phone call or to have a meeting when it’s some​thing that’s really serious and important that I need to be involved in …","Okay. Thank you.","Bye-bye.","You too. Bye.","Rich","I'm the President. ","It'll be 26 years in January. ","I've known the Executive Director I guess when I started. I believe it was Joe DeMachin (phon) that was there when I was there and then, of course, Wayne Smith. We coordinate regularly on issues that are common, with common interest to both of us, or sometimes even issues that maybe we're not directly involved but indirectly involved and we try and help each other out as much as we can. There are times—I can't think of many—over the years that maybe there'd be an issue that we conflict on, but that's not very often. ","Well, I also happen to serve on the State Healthcare Commission, on the DHIN, which is the Delaware Health Information Network, which is the organization transfers of records, medical records electronically. We're the first state—I think we're still the only state in the union, so that’s statewide. We're so small, so that's a big help. Because of those two relationships, there’s issues we're always working on together. I talk to Wayne all the time. We try and keep each other up to date on what's going on, on policy issues dealing with healthcare. Obviously, my members are interested in it because of the cost. All the hospitals in the state are also members of the State Chamber, so we have that relationship. Now, every once in a while maybe we'll call each other and say, “Hey, did you know that Health Bill 168, dealing with adding whatever procedure to coverage by the health insurance companies has been introduced?” or maybe (inaudible) several grants to look at the controlling healthcare costs, we trying to keep in touch with each other. This is the third and last year of the grant, and (inaudible) some of the ways that they're looking at controlling costs and how that might affect hospitals, which obviously, in a lot of instances, it does. ","I would think what they're most known for is representing the best interest of the hospitals. I think that people know, especially when they see Wayne Smith, because Wayne's former Majority Leader, if he shows up at your door, there's an issue that needs to be discussed, and he will present the position of the hospitals. So, anybody who—I’m not sure the public is familiar with him, and one of the reasons being the name, but I know that anybody who deals with healthcare, whether it be a doctor or a legislator or somebody administration or Federal delegation, they know who they are and who they represent, and I think there’s a lot of respect. It doesn't mean they always agree (phon), but I think they always have respect to their position. ","I just think without the name, hospital or medical center or whatever in the name, to the general public, it wouldn't be apparent right away that this is an organization that represents the hospital for the state. I don't know that that's a good thing or a bad thing. I just think that if I told somebody the Healthcare Association (phon), they wouldn't put two and two together necessarily. ","That could be something (inaudible) in the medical society because, once again, the medical society represents doctors. I'm not sure people in the public would know that, so there's always going to be that confusion. ","I think they represent to the—I mean, even though the public might not know what the name is, the fact is that when they have an issue or if there's something that's going on at one of the hospitals that people need to know about, I think they do a good job of letting the public know whatever the issue is or whatever's going on at one of the hospitals, whether it be an expansion or a new facility or a new treatment center, whatever. They're pretty good at letting the public, you know, helping spread that message along with the hospitals themselves. ","I think it's the personality, the personality of the leaders. The other thing maybe I should've mentioned before is once a month Wayne and I and the head of the Medical Society and the head of the largest—Highmark is our largest health insurer—we have breakfast and we spend a couple of hours just finding out what's going on, what's on the—are there any issues out there that maybe we don't know about, what's going on nationally. I mean, with all the changes or potential changes in the Affordable Care Act and with the business community, what are they looking at, what are the doctors looking at, what are the insurers—which is good. It's a good, healthy relationship, and it kind of keeps us all stay on message and see what there is that maybe conflicts or something we don't understand. I'm always anxious to go because I don't sometimes focus deeply, as I have so many issues going on I might not look as deeply at (inaudible), affects any one of the three organizations and how it affects each one of us, and we (inaudible) to work together. ","No, I wasn't the one who set it up. We were kind of late-comers to it. I know they were meeting for a couple of years and then they called me and said, “Look, we think it's a good idea. Would you like to sit in on these?” and I said, “Oh, yes.” I believe it was probably—I'm not sure whose idea it was, but I would suspect it was Wayne's idea. ","That's really—it's hard to say. I want to say, look, everything is great, they do a wonderful job and nothing ought to change, because things always change, you know, as they prepare (phon) for change. But we have such a good relationship with them and with the hospitals that I can't think of anything right now to say, “Look, they need to do this better or they need to do something.” As a matter fact, I know that Wayne—we do a video once a week and just kind of update our members on where things are, and at the end of the week we do a (inaudible)—send out to our members a weekly update, and everything from articles and magazines and newspapers that are relate to issues, and the video I do to my Head of the Government Affairs just blog and issue, and Wayne kind of picked up on it, they saw that and they asked me how we did it. It was actually pretty simple, it's not real sophisticated. He started to do that. You’re always looking for better ways to communicate your message. ","You know, I'm shocked, because there's a couple hundred people who read it every week and they comment to me, and then they stop me. I only do a couple of minutes. I don't know that I'm not good at it, but I try to get a message out there. I just think it's one more way to communicate with people, and younger people especially, that's how they communicate. We have somebody who handles that, they handle social media. I mean, that's how the younger people, the Millennials, that's how they communicate. I have a couple in my family. They don't read newspapers. They go on the Internet and they tweet and all those things. I don't. The people in my office, the younger people in my office do. But, yes, that's important. There's a lot of ways to communicate today and it changes. Honestly, I don't know how well,  (inaudible) I know. I know that Wayne's focused on that, trying to kind of keep up with it. ","I think—obviously, we're larger, on my staff is larger than Wayne's, so we can handle things maybe a little differently than he can. But, I think you need a leader, not a manager. Some people are leaders, some people are managers. There are few people who are both, do both well, but not many. I really think you needs a leader, somebody who understands how policy is made, how legislative procedure works, they've got to understand politics. They just have to have that kind of personality where people trust them, that they can explain the position. If they disagree with somebody, they can do it in a way that is not—isn’t going to be abrasive. Yes, for associations, I think that's important. ","I think they're effective. I'll give you an example. A few years back, not the past administration but the administration before that, Governor Ruth Ann Minner decided that she really was interested in cancer early detection and treatment. She decided that what she wanted was for everybody over the age of 50 in the state of Delaware to have a colonoscopy. She, as a matter of fact, had a program where people of a certain income level, the state would pay for it. Obviously, the Healthcare Association played a big role in getting that done. I think we went from something like 30% of the people in the state over the age of 50 having a colonoscopy to 75%, and we actually saw the rate of people who developed either colon cancer or rectal cancer drop in the state, and the number of deaths dropped, only because of that one initiative. Obviously, it couldn't have been done without the Governor and the administration working with the Healthcare Association, and I think they're focused on that. I mean, they want to keep people healthy. There are a number of other—right now the whole opioid crisis. I mean, they're (inaudible), we stress that almost every month, where are we what are we doing, who's doing what. We don't go pointing fingers, you know, whose fault is it, because it's too late for that. Now you have a situation you've got to handle and they play a big role in it.","No, I'd say they're a leader, they're a leader. They identify the problem and they want to help resolve it, if it's a problem, or identify a program which they think will be successful in keeping people healthy. There are other times when issues come up that they're on the other side, they're defending themselves. I forget, but six, seven years ago and they introduced a tax law on hospitals and Wayne did a pretty effective job of killing that. You have the other side, too. Sometimes you have to defend—things that happen in hospitals, sometimes you have to defend them. I mean, they're not—medical science is not an exact science and things happen. I think they do an effective job of doing that, and, like I say, trying to keep the hospitals kind of cooperating with each other, even though they are competitive.","Yes, I'm trying to think of—well, several years ago, there was a situation that went—(inaudible) wanted to rehab center in Middletown, in southern part of New Castle County, and the hospital, especially the Christiana Care, was opposed to it, they didn't want it to happen. We thought it was—we felt we needed it. Yes, we kind of worked together and we came to an agreement, and (phon) they could have them, what the size could be and all of that, and it was built. Like I said, we were in favor of it, we thought we needed it. We thought, okay, well, a little bit of competition, but that's not always a bad thing, and it got worked out. So, the facility is done. As a matter fact, it turns out the hospital ended up building a facility across the street for emergencies and things of that kind. They have to work with each other. Christiana (inaudible). I think that's important. We're always looking (inaudible). It doesn't happen often, but when it does, I mean, we talk to each other. We don't (inaudible), because 90% of the time we're going to work together. That 10%, we’ll work it out and see if there's some middle ground.","Not off the top of my head. The key is you want to keep your population as healthy as possible. We have—and also costs are an issue. Almost a quarter of the population of this state is on Medicaid. When you take the—and I've mentioned this to people who comment (phon) when they speak and they kind of—their guess at percentages. But when you take the people who are on Medicare and combine it with the ones that are on Medicaid, and the people who work for either state or local government and the federal government, and there are some others who aren't in state health, almost 50% of our population is on some government health plan, so you've got to deal with that. That's always an issue for the hospital, because obviously they don't pay as well as maybe Highmark might or somebody who's got—it's hard. I know it's hard. It's really hard. The other thing that they were a big help with is transferring electronic health records. I mean, hospitals play a huge role in that. All the hospitals are members of the—what do you call it—the Health Information Network, are members, and they're always looking at better ways to use the network and better ways to make it work. Obviously, the Healthcare Association plays a huge role in that. ","No, not as long as Wayne’s there. I just think that whenever they—Wayne and (Inaudible) were really good stewards and work very closely. I just think they need to make sure that we have leaders that—the people who understand the relationship can work together. I don't know anything else that they could do better. The only thing I would say, if they wanted better recognition within the public, yes, the name is confusing. Maybe it's better that way. But I think most people in this state have a lot of respect for the hospitals in this state. I think generally they have a positive view of the hospitals. ","That's interesting. Intelligent, knowledgeable, also compassionate, and I think they would understand—what am I saying, how am I going to say it—understand how the game is played, understand how to get things done. ","No, only that I enjoy working with them, I enjoy the relationship, and I think together we've accomplished a lot over the years and in the future I think, obviously, that's going to continue. ","I'm happy to do it. Thank you. Have a good weekend, guys. ","Thank you. Yes. I will.","Theodore W. Becker","I have been the Mayor of Lewes, Delaware for three years and four months. I was on City Council for 10 years prior to that.","The Delaware Healthcare Association and the city have not had any direct interaction that I'm aware of. Obviously, the city participates in the State Healthcare Plan, so we rely pretty much on the state for that and for direct provision of insurance purposes and solving most of our healthcare needs for our employees. The city has not had any direct interaction with them. However, I'm familiar with the Delaware Healthcare Association through my role on the Health Care Commission, as a member of that.","I have been a member of the Delaware Health Care Commission for about nine years. I was appointed as the representative for Sussex County by then-governor—I guess it was Governor Minner just at the end of her term.","The Commission meets monthly, generally speaking, with minor exceptions. I mean, we cancelled the July meeting because there wasn't a quorum, but generally we meet monthly.","Yes, sir.","I think they're most known for maintaining good communication with the Health Care Commission and to ensure that the Health Care Commission is keeping up with current crises or areas of need, as well as changes that are going on statewide. Obviously, the State of Delaware is growing rapidly and growing grey rapidly, which creates some pretty unique situations for us, being a small state without a medical school. I think the Healthcare Association has really been helpful in continuing that dialogue.","I'm not sure anybody has a direct solution. I think continuing the dialogue, maintaining an active role in the kinds of things that are coming before the Health Care Commission, and participating in the numerous public venues that are being offered throughout the state.","I really don't have any areas that I would suggest that need improvement. I think overall they do a good job.","It sounds a little redundant, but promoting the dialogue and ensuring that there is adequate attention paid to the underserved or the unaddressed needs of a community. One of the things that I think we've, of recent times, have been talking about a great deal, and certainly it's being talked about at state agencies, is the opioid addiction. But also in Sussex County in particular, we've had a very big shortage of mental health providers. That remains to be an issue. We are now finally getting a hundred-bed treatment facility constructed over in Georgetown, and I think that's a real plus.","I think, right now, I see it more as a participant than a leader, but certainly there have been times when—I can't give you specifics, but I think the questions that have been asked have been such that they've encouraged the dialogue that maybe would not have occurred had the questions not been asked. If you want to call that leadership, I would say that, yes, they have had some leadership role.","I think they're pretty effective. Obviously, anybody can increase their effectiveness depending upon their relationships that they've built with members who are in decision-making positions.","They're not something that would immediately come to my head as somebody I would reach out to, but certainly, they're there. As a member of the Commission, I tend to rely on the full-time staff there to provide those kind of interactions. They've done a good—mostly it's been good, a good level of interaction going on between full-time staff.","Yes, at the Commission, yes.","I don't think there's ever been what I would call a real strong disagreement that I'm aware of. I think that we tend to work cooperatively. Obviously, different points of views, but I don't think there's been a point where there's been major points of disagreement that I'm aware of.","I think so. That's been my perception.","Wayne is a great representative. He is a good collaborator. I really think he goes out of his way to work well with any member of the Health Care Commission or any member in the healthcare provision in the state to ensure that there's good dialogue. I am very pleased with what happened so I don't have any particular thing in mind that I think could be done better. He's a regular member attending the Health Care Commission meetings and is an active participant.","Sure.","Well, obviously there are a couple of things. We have a new Executive Director for the Health Care Commission, there's just been a change there so things are going to change a little bit. There's been a lot of turnover in the last couple of years. I think getting—we're going to see how that works out, but we have—the opioid thing continues, the implementation of the SIM grant and what that means and how we go forward with that, with all the national discussion about what's going to happen with healthcare insurance. I think all of those things put the Commission in a strange position right now until we have some further direction as to how—what's healthcare cost coverage, insurance going to look like as we go forward? I think everybody's wrestling with that.","Nine.","Yes, it is. It's very helpful. I think things tend to ebb and flow with the perspective, but there are certain things that obviously have to go forward and need to be attended to on a regular basis.","Absolutely. Delaware being very small and the healthcare network being pretty tight, it is—yes. It is absolutely 100% true, the relationship business. It is very—we see that not only in the provision of healthcare, but in our three representatives to the U.S. Congress with Coons, Carper and Lisa Blunt Rochester are highly visible in the state. Many of us feel—I mean, I see Senator Carper is all over the state. I saw him twice this past weekend. He is very interested in healthcare, so is Senator Coons. Lisa Blunt Rochester is obviously a newly-elected member, but she too is doing her best to get out and be involved with the community, as is our Governor.","Yes, and I think also the other thing that changes some of this is the influx of new individuals or new residents of the state who've come from other states where they've had—particularly in Sussex County where they've had access to various forms of healthcare much closer—has helped raise the bar, even at a local level. You see the hospitals responding in their expansion or growth plans, or plans for expansion.","Right.","One of the things, as we looked for cost containment or look to control costs, there probably is an opportunity to ensure that there isn't duplication of services and that things are provided as close to home as possible. One of the things that has been a challenge downstate in this area has been pediatric care as well, because the local hospital, Beebe, does not have a pediatrics ward. If you have a child or an infant who is in need of care, they're automatically off to A.I. duPont, which obviously is a problem in terms of helping to deliver care at the most effective level without using a major medical facility. If the child needs to go there, fine, but I think that if we had more resources downstate we could probably do a lot better in terms of cost containment.","Exactly. Routine, and minor issues that children need.","I think they're pretty well epitomized in Wayne. Wayne is a very personable guy and he reaches out consistently. All my interaction with him has been very positive, I think he does a great job and he's a very good face for the organization. I think he's a winner.","No problem.","Okay. How many people are you interviewing for this, if I might ask?","No problem. Thank you. I look forward to seeing your report. Thank you.","You too. Bye-bye."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Speaker<\/th>\n      <th>Text<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"pageLength":500,"dom":"irt","searchHighlight":true,"autoWidth":true,"order":[],"orderClasses":false,"orderCellsTop":true,"lengthMenu":[10,25,50,100,500]}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
