I purchased my 77 acre farm property in 2011 with 3 building lots (A-B-C) included on the property. These lots are currently located along the Fairfield Rd. side (West) of the farm. I received approval from Hopewell Township in 2014 to relocate these lots to other areas on the farm. Lot \"A\" is to be relocated to the east side of the farm just to the northwest of the existing 1 acre pond. This would put lot \"A\" directly below proposed line segment #182. Remaining lots \"B\" and \"C\" are to be relocated to the East side of the property in the woods at the southeast corner of the property. Lots B-C would be in direct proximity to proposed line segments #181/#183. In addition, proposed line segment #182 traverses a path across my property that essentially cuts the property in half. Also, lines #181/#183 are in direct conflict with environmentally sensitive areas at my pond and wetlands/stream area beside the wooded area near relocated lots \"B\" and \"C\".

Farms such as the Wiley Farm and the wedding venue area in Jolly Acres area would definitely be impacted. \nI thank you for the opportunity to comment. I find it hard to believe the savings to be realized is probably now existent in this area. We have a surplus of power generation plants in the local 25 mile radius, all of which is supposed to give us savings. I have never seen a reduction in fees only increases.

Second, any potential effects on the conserved lands in the area and species in the area. Third, wells and septics on residential properties. \nIdeally following already existing power line grids is most highly recommended. However I would ask that you avoid the elementary school area and any locations that could possibly create \"eye sores\" for this area - we are all very proud of the farmers and love the agricultural lifestyle, while others have migrated to this area because of the natural beauty of the rural views in this area. Who would want a tower affecting their pristine views as they work, relax, etc in their own back yards.\nPlease use pole/tubular as opposed to 4 pedestal towers\nWhile everyone would consider their property to be the one ideally left out of thus project, I ask you to consider the effects on small farms that a tower could have, as opposed to a lesser overall effect a tower would have on parcels that are much, much larger.\nwe farm hay (seasonal) as an income on a small parcel and we rely on that income to address taxes and other expenses we have yearly. The impact on us would be much greater that if you were to put a tower on one's land who farms a large parcel of land as they could turnover costs on the remaining land.\nAreas that are of additional concern - historical areas used to be mills at Jolly Acres and 23 acreas, the local orchards and cattle farms\nWhy wouldn't you consider up the I-83 corridor, which has already been built-up?\nAdditional proposal to consider this route: 113-174-177-194<br>6/9/2017","<b>Timothy Smith<\/b><br>4339 Madonna Road Street,Maryland 21154<br>tomotay.smith@gmail.com<br><br>I am very much opposed to the proposed electric transmission lines on or near my property.

The center study segments cross an area where there is high traffic congestion from retail, restaurants, medical facilities, and high truck traffic around I-81, US 30, US 11, and Norland Avenue.  Construction of the project here would likely increase traffic delays, accidents, and congestion in an area that already cannot handle the traffic flow with the existing tenants, ongoing development, and inadequate traffic flow from I-81 to Norland Avenue and Walker Road.\nWhile the farthest west and farthest east study segments also cross US 30, the areas they cross are not congested areas like the middle study segments.  \nThank you,\nCheryl Evans<br>6/14/2017","<b>Holly Holly<\/b><br>Cleveland Ave, Chambersburg, PA 17201<br><br><br>I disagree with your proposed plans to bring power lines through our community.

I did not attend the meeting not because I did not care but because I was not aware of it.  Several months ago, I was fully aware of the fact that some entity of the power company was going to be on my property to cut trees and spray chemicals.  I was aware because they sent a live person to my front door that made contact with me.  When I learned by the foreman that the trees they cut into 300+ pound sections were within the boundaries of the \"agreement\", I was astounded and invited him to help me move them even though \"It is my problem and not theirs\".   The manner that this \"meeting\" was announced was absolutely unacceptable, and in my eyes, sneaky.  I am sure it was thrown away with the piles of \"junk\" mail received.   \nMy wife and I purchased this HOME on approximately 2.26 acres because of the beauty of the home itself, the land it is on, and the view it provides.  When I learned that there are plans to potentially build a 30Ftx30Ftx135Ft tower smack dab in the middle of the yard my young children and I play in, I immediately felt my heart skip a beat and my face turn red.  I realize that our home is not a million dollar mansion, but it is our home and we work extremely hard to be able to afford it.  A monstrosity of an electrical tower in the middle of our front \"play\" yard will undoubtedly reduce the value of our house.  The potential HEALTH RISKS that this tower would bring is not something that I want at all!  No amount of money paid is worth the safety and health of my family to include my TWO SMALL CHILDREN.  \nAlthough the limited information on your website says that it will reduce costs of electric, I maintain that no amount of energy cost savings is worth a compromised view, damage to a DNR maintained trout stream, lowered property values, and HEALTH of my CHILDREN.  Please consider alternate routes or take the millions of dollars that this project will cost and apply a small amount to everyone's monthly bill.  I know that there are studies that say that electrical towers do not affect health but I also know there are studies that say there IS a direct correlation between power lines and health problems ESPECIALLY young children.  The Courts tend to agree with my assessment.  If this company needs testimony to this fact, they can reach across the country and ask Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) who is now $333 million dollars poorer since their 1993 court case.\nI promise you that the aforementioned sentence is by no means a threat.

Ash Lane Shippensburg, PA  17257<br>Bearlin@pa.net<br><br>Further comments-in addition to those filed in person, June 13, 2017 regarding segment 381 of proposed powerline \"Independence\" and the western substation site.\nA primary concern is the continued quality of living for the persons residing along this segment. Currently twenty family dwellings are closely tied to the water provided by the aquifer underlying the land along this short mileage segment. One quarter of these families depend on livestock related agriculture to provide income and require large water volume to continue to be viable. Well depths vary from 50' to 500' from personal communications with the residents.  Water flow rates are also variable. \nFrom past history along this Rice Road corridor, from Pine Stump Road to Mount Rock Road, any drilling for additional wells for new home well for drinking water or geothermal wells has resulted in water disturbances up to and including dry wells being reported. The soils are from the Hagerstown and Ryder soils groups and the associated steeply inclined Zullinger limestone formation. This formation transmits water via fractures in the rock and is sensitive to disturbances. Bedrock is exposed. Surfaces are steeply sloped and underlain with karst formations, succeptible to sinkhole formation. Information is from the Franklin County soil survey Aug 1975, maps 29 and 35, and other sources online, such as PASDA, as well as personal communications with residents. Any drilling into for tower anchoring or levelling of this area for the substation would likely be a detriment to the water sources for these residents. Any reduction or elimination of water sources would significantly affect in a negative way the livlihood of numerous residents.\nAlternatively, The proposed substation site east of I81 would be on more level strata of Murrill gravelly loams. These soils are deep with greater depth to bedrock and formed from colluvial sandstones and shales. Excavation, grading and tower installation would find less exposed limestone outcrop.\nCrop land providing feed for two dairies and additional heifer raising herds, chickens, an orchard, pasture and browse for a natural fiber farm and established plantings for a tree farm are located immediately adjacent to or directly under the proposed segment 381 or the proposed Rice substation site lying west of I81. Effects to cropland production, silviculture, pasture and browse would adversely affect residents' livlihood if acreage available were reduced, altered in erosion capacity, destroyed or contaminated by invasive species brought in on construction equipment.\nThis immediate region is also steeply sloped and provides ground cover, wildlife transit corridors and windbreak to the homes lying east of the proposed right of way vegetative cutting, i.e. We would lose our winter protection of homes and field plantings arising from storms right in front and downslope from our homes. Our farm would lose afternoon shade of pasture and livestock. Removal of vegetative cover could change local microclimates.\nAlong the 381 segment within the right of way proposed setback is an existing high tensile electrified pasture fence acquired through a grant with PA DCNR Project Grass. this fence must be maintained in agreement wilth the grant requirements. It cannot be removed. Although small, this pasture is maintained using rotational grazing and we adhere to best management practices for the steeply sloped area, in fact we were aproved for steeply sloped pasture criteria in the early 2000s by USDA. Erosion from ground disturbance would be a problem on this steeply sloped land if ground area is disturbed near fencing. Residual effects from high voltage may affect performance of pasture fencing.\nOur farm uses no herbicide or pesticide application to fields pasture, gardens and woodlots and would lose production browse and pasture if spray drifted from maintenance along this segment. \nOur farm is registered and approved as a PA Preferred agricultural producer of wool, cashmere and alpaca fiber. We have worked years to improve genetics in the herd and flock to make possible a product entirely derived from Pennsylvania sources in growth, harvest, milling, spinning and garment fabrication. Losing our pasture through changes to forage growth would cease production. One farm would be lost from PA Preferred status.\nSeveral resident families harvest deer and other wildlife, fruits, nuts and berries in the immediate area of segment 381 covered by forest and field. This food source would be affected by any sprays or cutting of the right of way. \nSo far I've addressed water supply, food production, farming, microclimates, wildlife. Let's introduce one remaining concern- money. The Transource Company states repeatedly in its local public relations notes that this new Independence Transmission Connection will save \"the people\" $600 million in electric costs over 15 years. Which people? \nThe residents along segment 381 have farms, homes and acreage that may be the ONLY source of income in their retirement, or in sales possibilities as income for their children in this lifetime. Devaluing our real estate is an up front, immediate fallout from the 15 year projected benefit to the \"electric consumer\" . The white paper detailing the project seems to overlook real effects to the closest contact people.\nThe bottom line here is company costs and profits. Segment 381 is a straight line from point A to point B, the Rice substation. It may look to be low in company cost, but from the residents' view, the cost is extremely high. The addition of this segment's visual impact, right of way restrictions, potential adverse effects to water supply, soil production, crops , trees, wildlife, livestock and persons living and working near it will not improve the nearby residents' income or reduce their electric costs over 15 years. The impact to this little group of twenty families would be significant- in an adverse manner.\nI respectfully ask you to consider these comments when deciding the route and substation location.

Community Affairs Representative, Independence Project\nFROM:  Kathleen M. Brown, Ph.D., 2400 Island Branch Rd., White Hall, MD 21161\n             East Study Area, Parcel # 4020\nRE:  Independence Project, East Study Area, Line Seg. 118 and 120\nThank you for sending me a copy of the V2 route map.  The maps presented on your website and in your mailings were not detailed and many residents of the Norrisville/Jarrettsville area were unaware that your proposed line routes would cross their properties.  Your mailings were not made in enough time and were also not detailed enough for residents to make informed comments at the June 7 meeting.  \nI submitted my comments then but after further consideration have more to say, particularly about your proposed line Segments 118 and 120.  These two proposed segments pass through a subdivision known as \"Nestling Winds\" which is more densely populated than the surrounding countryside. It contains about ten 10 acre parcels, each with houses, barns, and other outbuildings.  On these small properties the installation of 135 ft towers with electric lines and service roads would be unfairly disruptive to residents.  In addition, there is a public safety concern associated with the installation of towers on these small holdings.  Assuming that towers would be required where line segment 120 changes direction, a tower would be installed on the property of Harford Co. Councilman, Chad Shodes.  He and his brother, Tim, are the parents of at least 3 young children.  Similarly, a tower would be constructed on the southern edge of the property of Laurel Smith Woodall very close to the homes of Allen McElwain Jr. and his brother Ben.  A total of 5 young children live in those houses. Proposed line segment 118 also crosses close to the house and buildings of Ernie McElwain, who is the father of 2 young children.  We hope you will agree that the proposed line segments 118 and 120 cross an area that is too densely populated for the safe construction or operation of your lines.\nThere are other important considerations.  One is the preservation of some of the best argricultural lands currently under cultivation in Harford Co. The surrounding farms of Allen McElwain Sr. and Ernie McElwain are both in the Ag Preservation Program. The farm of James Wiley and Pond View Farm on Jolly Acres Rd. are under cultivation and are also important agri-businesses in the area. Another concern is the preservation of the numerous ponds and streams in the area which drain into Deer Creek.\nThe Norrisville/Jarrettsville area is in the process of organizing resistance to the construction of Transource power lines in the Harford Co. part of the East Study Area. Residents and elected officials are meeting tonight to exchange information and sign petitions urging Transource to adopt line routes north and west of Norrisville in the more open country of Balto. Co. and Pa.  These petitions will be sent to you and to Harford Co. elected officials and government agencies.\nThank you for your polite attention to our concerns.  Please keep in touch.\nKathleen M.

It was very well attended by residents who are determined to resist the construction of those line segments.  We discussed the short notice given and the inadequate info on your plans.  The Harford Co. Council has been informed and we are making plans to take these problems to the Md. Public Services Commission.  We have formed a special subcommittee to handle these matters.  It is called \"The Power Lines Action Committee\" and it will meet July 12, 2017 6:30 pm at the Norrisville Fire Station.  Among other things, we will discuss obtaining legal advice. Another topic of importance to me personally and other residents on adjoining properties is the damage to property values done by the construction of your enormous towers and lines which will destroy the beautiful views that are now an important selling point of our properties.\nYou and Harford Co officials will soon be receiving signed petitions from Norrisville residents which ask you to use proposed power line routes West of Md.

No notice was sent to my house regarding a public meeting on June 7th. I just found out about this today. I am mainly concerned about proposed \"Line 120\" on AEP East Over as I just purchased this house in January ($465,000) and the proposed line would run through my backyard less than 100 feet from my house. This would severely devalue the new property I just purchased, not to mention the eyesore in my backyard and right next to my new house. I, of course, am in objection to this \"Line 120\" on AEP East Over. This proposed line goes through the backyards of several other residences on Island Branch Road and a good portion of environmentally protected land.

Taxpayers have made an investment in these lands for agricultural / food production.  Where possible use lands not in the Ag Conservation Easement purchase program, or a land Trust Program.  The PA taxpayers have a made financial commitment to these lands and as supported by public policy thee lands should remain exclusively for ag production. As I looked at your maps  during a June 6th meeting it was clear alternative non preserved lands were possible routes. As the PA substation site has not been selected you still have a opportunity to select non preserved lands. This is a request to seek your willingness to work with the PA Ag Community many of whom are Farm Bureau Members.  \nA second request is to attempt to avoid enrolled ASA lands to minimize impacts to those farm operations.  Many dairy farms in the Lower Chanceford region have made recent capital improvements to their family farms and anticipate financial rewards however stray voltage issues would serve to undermine their farm improvements.  Efforts to install this new electric infrastructure will harm valuable farming soil structure and losses will continue for years due to soil compaction and subsoil remaining on the upper levels.\nIntroducing towers to large contiguous acres of cropland will introduce wildlife habitat at each pole with resulting crop damage and holes creating farm tractor hazards.  Farmers are all to familiar with the lack of maintenance associated with towers and ROW lines and the burden then falls to the farmer to deal with. \nEfforts to work with each farmer is critical as the energy industry seeks to export PA's energy.

This agreement made with York County and the Commonwealth of PA places many restrictions on the property now and in the future. The ground cannot be developed or used in ways that are inconsistent with approved agricultural practices.

This is to provide access to an existing 500kv power line in our area and eventually connect to an exisiting substation south to an existing substation near ringold MD. We were given fairly clear answers posed by us and some our neighbors who attended the meeting. As we walked through the information stations the size and configuration of the new towers and their right-of-way were explained. obviously this will be an intrusive eyesore in an area that is primarily agriculture and woodland. In addition there are many beautiful and well maintained residences in the area. After much questioning with Steve Tinsley itis apparent except for the substation 30 acre plots, which will be outright purchases from the exisiting property owners, the balance of the huge acreage needed for the line will be an easement arrangement for the 130 foot right of way with the affected landowners. It is my understanding if agreements can not be reached the right of way could be obtained by eminent domain. based on the two alternatives for the rice road substation and connecting lines the substation should be located on the east side of RT81 on the sands property and not on the west side of 81 affecting our properties. The karst geology in this area and fragile nature of ground water can not be ignored. Your people indicated to develop the new substation on the bob martin traction the west side of rt 81 blasting would probably be done to level the site for the new substation. We also observed and noted to your staff that after viewing the detailed aerial photos there were great inaccuracies with regard to street names and property owners in the immediate area of the proposed line 381. You completely missed carol hozman and therefore be aware and comment because she is located right on your proposed line 381. There seemed to be a lack of knowledge by your staff that all the homes in this area are not served by public water. All of the residences and farms have wells for their water supply which is easily disrupted by heavy construction. There have been occasions when rather distant well drilling has caused problems with existing wells. This whole area on the west side of rt81 depends on the fragile limestone aquifers. As the conversations with your staff continued Laurie was very carefully making notes of these concerns. A very serious impact on the farms and residences and farming activities in this area (west of rt81) in the vicinity of this substation and associated lines must be addressed. The farming in this area is done as small family farms for crop, dairy and fruit production. There is no \"spare\" land for non agricultural, commercial, or industrial use- in short every acre counts. In our personal situation hay is made each year to supplement feed on 2 adjoining dairy farms. At our property this is vital. Additionally I have operated a choose and cut christmas tree operation for several years in the very fields you are proposing for the 381 line alignment. Another adjoining neighbor (barry & linda singly) operate a sheep, goat and fiber business that would be seriously impacted or destroyed. It should also be noted that there are several farm houses and bulling 5 located in this area west of 81 that are civil war and earlier and should not be disturbed. Please consider these comments in making your decisions on this project and keep us posted in any changes of route or time lines.<br>6/19/2017","<b>Robert H & Karen K Gochenaur<\/b><br>3449 Delta Road Airville , PA  17302<br><br><br>our family own and operates 2 farms that are both preserved in lower chanceford township.

These classified streams are defined as those that support a population of wild trout of sufficient size and abundance to support a long term and rewarding sport fishery. To help explain the protections that these streams have in place I would like to quote the executive director of the PFBC, John Arway, Froman article in the March/April issue of the Penna Angler, the official publication of the PFBC. \"if the PFBC designates a stream as Class A and the DEP accepts that Commission data, then the Penna DEP is required by regulation to protect the water quality of that stream as a high quality coldwater fishery.

In addition, the wetlands in or along the flood plains of all of our wild trout streams are protected as Exceptional Value (EV) wetlands. EV wetlands can't be disturbed because of their value in storing and gradually releasing water in order to maintain base flows to protect the survival and maintain wild trout populations through periods of flood and drought.\" So as a Guilford Township citizen and a member (President) of the falling spring chapter of Trout Unlimited we are very concerned about the transmission lines and towers that wold surely effect the riparian buffer zones and wetland areas along the world famous wild trout fishery called the falling spring.<br>6/14/2017","<b>Douglas E & Julia C Martin<\/b><br>3926 Guilford Springs Road Chambersburg, PA  17202<br>pvjerseys@yahoo.com<br><br>Re: 374 suggest running it through wasteland by Tapeworm Road instead of prime farm land.

Besides my family , this farm is the most important thing in my life.  That is why in 1990 the decision was made to place the farm in the Land Preservation Program.  My family and I wish to keep this land open and free to be farmed by my children, grandchildren, and future McElwain generations.  We love this land and wish to preserve it.  Marrying it with towers will only take away from it.\nThe land that will be used to construct the towers is land that should be used to produce food .  Once that land is taken away, it can never be returned to its original state.  It may be a small parcel of land to you, but for us, it could be several hundred bushels of corn, soy beans or wheat.  That is how we earn our living.\nAdditionally several times over the past several years, this farm has been asked to give up land for the betterment of the community.  Carea Road and Rt 136 were constructed cutting precious land from our farm.  I believe we have given enough.\nThank you for your consideration.\nSincerely,\nAllen S.

The construction of these proposed lines cross property that has been preserved and protected by the Agricultural Preservation and farm and Natural Land Trusts. There is an agreement in place with York County and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania that places consistent restrictions on the property to insure the property remains solely agricultural and in no way used for commercial development. Construction of you proposed power lines on the property or running through the property is a direct violation of this significant and necessary agreement to protect not only the land but the wildlife.\nAs a homeowner and land owner, I also fully oppose to the construction of these power lines. We the homeowners, purchased homes and/or land specifically in this area due to the natural environment. Constructing visible and audible power lines through this area would destroy not only the established ecosystem, but what the homeowners/land owners have worked hard for. Studies show that properties in close proximity to power lines lost an average of 6.3 % in property value. Not a significant loss to a huge company, but it would be a complete loss to the people who have worked hard to live in an area of their choice and to provide a \"country atmosphere\" for their children to grow up in.\nMy children are yet another reason i fiercely oppose the construction of the power lines. There are studies that state high voltage power lines cause cancer and there are also studies that object and state they do not. BUT...there is not one single study that states there is a 100 % guarantee that high voltage power lines do not cause cancer or pose any other health risk. A risk I am not willing to take. I have 3 healthy children and I in no way want a possible health risk in proximity to our home, especially when it is completely unnecessary. If you choose to ignore all of the homeowner's pleas and construct the power lines, your company will be the first to blame if any of my children develop a health issue..... any health issue.\nSincerely, \nRhonda Jones<br>6/23/2017","<b>Karen Benedict<\/b><br>5419 Manheim Road Waynesboro, PA  19268<br>karrib@gmail.com<br><br>One of the proposed paths for your project crosses over the corner of our property.  We live on the remaining 8 acres of my family's dairy farm, which has been in our family since the mid-1800s.  It is a secluded property surrounded by orchards and farm fields.  My husband and I don't have much in the way of material wealth, but have worked hard to have and keep this home.  My husband works 50 hours a week.  Frankly, we don't want this power line crossing our property, even on the corner, or adjacent to our property.  Our hope is to stay here when we retire (my father was born, lived most of his life, and died in this house at the age of 92).  But the possibility does exist that one or both of us may not be able to do that.  In that eventuality, the only thing we have of value to help us in our old age is this property.  In addition to our own personal objection to living in very close proximity to 135-foot-high steel towers carrying multiple buzzing high tension power lines, we have a justifiable fear that the installation of a high-tension power line over or directly adjacent to our property will have a negative impact on its value.  The property is too small to generate any income with agriculture, and our location and seclusion are substantial factors in its value.\nIt makes more sense to locate these towering steel structures along a corridor which already has this type of or similar installation or public utilities, or in a remote location, rather than in the middle of pastoral farm land interspersed with moderately dense populations.  the construction of the proposed line along the route adjacent to adjacent to me and most likely many of the other routes nearby, would ultimately degrade the quality of life in our Franklin County farm country.\nFrankly, I am not happy with the proposed construction of a power line that has the effect of decreasing the quality of my life, and that of my fellow Franklin county residents in order that someone else may pay a little less for their electricity.  Especially when Franklin county has a median income that is much less (from 50% to 75% less) than that many of our neighbors to the south.\nWe feel you should also know that both our property and the piece to the north of us (now owned by John Rudolph) are the low point of a large watershed through which your proposed line directly runs.

DoyleDoyle Farm<\/b><br>158 Norris Road Delta, PA  17314<br>doylefarm@gmail.com<br><br>Letter of proposed site S5\nTo whom it concerns,\nI have lived on my property, Doyle Farm, since 1979.  At that time the area beyond my fence was a corn field.  The farm floods every spring from the run-off of my neighbor's fields and after hard summer rains. So the first project was to keep water on and in the land.  Since that time, I have planted on the farm every year towards an environmentally sound landscape.  This especially includes the piece of my property your proposed plan will clear cut.\nHawthorns, Shrubby Dogwoods, Pines and Catalpas are planted on that site.  The birds brought in the rest.  It is a habitat for quite a few bird species.  I only know a handful, but when I first lived here, there were no birds.  If you need an actual count, I can get the Audubon Societies of York and Lancaster Chapters to come and count the bird species for you.  They said they would be glad to help.  Not only has the bird population increased in the 37 years I have lived here but there are at least a few species of owls I hear.\nThat area also provides shelter for deer.  I often see them in there and I notice that the female does with fawns know they are safe.  The farm has foxes, rabbits, raccoons, pheasants, and wild turkeys that also find shelter and protection in those thickets.  Voles and moles attract eagles that nest in the woods NE of my property and I see plenty of hawks.\nDoyle Farm is a \"Green Space\" as noticed on your map and an oasis in a desert of monocultures and chemical sprays.  Once I spent summers not seeing a butterfly.  Now the farm is a stopping station for the Monarch, whose habitat is endangered, and pollinators such as humming birds, ask the Butterfly Societies of York and Lancaster to count them for you.\nMy property is also habitat for bees, not honey bees, but native bees.  They nest in the ground and rotting tree limbs.  There are so many varieties I have no need to worry about pollinating any of my vegetable plants.  Whereas my Amish neighbor says she must.  Native bees are being lost to pesticides and herbicides sprays.  And I am well aware of when my farmer neighbors spray, as they are aware of me.  I can get a Xerces Society to come and count bees. I would have to get people from the government or a conservancy.\nThese are the reasons why I do not want your proposed power line to run through my property.\nAs for the site you draw your line thru, there is seepage, so much that in the thaw of spring, I have lost a boot from my foot because of the wet.  I had my land dowsed once by a local man because I thought to put a pond near the road. He assured me these underground springs could fill it. That is reason I planted the area with trees because I couldn't farm it.  It also allows a decrease in my land taxes. \nAlso note: The land across Norris Road (Tayacres) has springs in his lower field next to the ditch.  I've seen them abandon their tractors because they couldn't drive them out.  That water source is on the USDA geology survey map.\nAs for my house, it is 1860's tenant farm house with outbuildings.  We have geese, chickens, guineas, peacock, dogs and cats.  We sell eggs and I plant an organic vegetable garden and sell the produce.\nPrior to my retirement business, Doyle Farm Nursery sold perennials and native plants.  It was quite successful and I know many people who would come and support my request to save my land and the wildlife habitat it has created.\nAs well as being a horticulturalist, I am a published writer, speaker, enthusiastic native plant professional.  I did write for a local newspaper as a local reporter and columnist.  I still submit articles from time to time.\nYour meeting caught me by chance as I was attending a native plant conference at the same time. I came home early Thursday to receive a phone call from my neighbor who told me of your proposed plan to cut thru our properties.  This took me by surprise.\nAccording to the map I received in the mail, your project area shows EAST of Route 74.  We live WEST. I hadn't planned to attend.  However, as I look very closely with a magnifying glass, I see it says \"existing\".  It is very misleading of your company.

I am writing to you to day in regards to the proposed high voltage power lines in Franklin County.  One of the proposed routes of the power lines places them along White Church Road in Chambersburg.  Transource identifies the routes a s324, 301, and 302.\nThe proposed route is going thru land that has been preserved under the Farmland Preservation Program.

Both my wife and I are concerned about the long term health effects on our family.  There are several legitimate scientific studies that identify several dangers of living near high voltage power lines.\nMy wife and I are also concerned about the value of our property going down.  Studies that I have seen show that property values will go down by 5% to 8%.  I have asked your representatives about this and they have told us that we will not be compensated for our loss.  We were told will not be compensated because the power lines are about 600 to 1200 yards to the north of our home. \nWe we purchased our home in 2015 we knew that we would have to contend with the nearby landfill.  Now there is a possibility of having these high voltage power lines.  If these power lines are installed we will not have one nice view of the area that we live in.   The sight of these power lines will inhibit everyone's view of Michaux state forest.\nThere is also an airstrip in the area between Orchard Road and Interstate 81.  There is a very real possibility that your proposed route could interfere with aircraft.\nI could have easily sent you an e-mail with my concerns.  However, a letter is a tangible item.  Our home and health is tangible to my family.  Just as you hold this very real letter, these power lines are a very real possibility.  I would ask that you deeply consider another route for your power lines that do not transverse the White Church Road area.

The property has been in my family since before the 1850's. Our water source is a natural spring that has been in use for countless years, and the property is most likely the site of Native American hunting camps, judging from the large quantity of flint artifacts that are to be found here. The artifacts include spear tips, scraping tools, drilling tools, and large quantities of cast offs from the flint napping process. The power line also passes directly over a stone quarry that dates from the late 1700's. \nI object to the construction of this power line in Franklin County for a number of reasons, one being the negative impact that it will have on the property values of all along the route. The other is the impact on the quality of life of those along the route. The em radiation from these high tension lines does have an impact on plant and animal life along their route.

We were the developers of the housing development we live in. We had to purchase a farm to acquire the site for our dream home. We worked for ten years in design, permitting and infrastructure installation before we could build our home. We paid the power company to put the existing above ground electrical lines underground. The entire housing development we built has underground utilities.\nOur home is twenty five feet above the Falling Spring Stream and has a view of about eight hundred feet of the Falling Spring Stream. Six rooms of our home are built with views of this beautiful scene. There is about thirty feet of glass windows overlooking this priceless view. There is no amount of money you could pay us to destroy this view. Most homes are not built with the sole reason of their location being a specific view. Our whole housing development was built because it was the only way we could get this specific site.\nThe Falling Spring Stream is a very high quality natural cold water limestone spring stream and the trout are native trout. This stream is not stocked like many trout streams in Pennsylvania. This area of the Falling Spring Stream is fly fishing catch and release only. The native trout are very wild and dart frantically about when they see you or your shadow.  They are not like stocked nursery trout that have this wild trait bred out of the gene pool.  Working around, along, and over this stream will be very disruptive to the native trout in this stretch of the Falling Spring Stream. The vibration of blasting or hammering the limestone rock near the stream will send vibrations through the ground into the stream spooking the wild trout.\nCutting existing trees and preventing new trees being planted along this stretch of the stream will degrade the stream by allowing sunlight to warm the stream water and surrounding land so that surface water entering the stream will be warmer.\nProposed segment 367 appears to cross over the Falling Spring Stream twice and parallels or overhangs the falling Spring Stream for a distance of about five hundred feet. This is a very poor choice for a proposed route since it will impact the Falling Spring Stream and native trout population more than any other of the proposed routes. It would be best if a route were chosen that will not even cross the Falling Spring Stream. Failing that a route that crosses the falling Spring Stream once at a ninety degree angle would have the less impact than segment 367.\nI am in the process of interviewing law firms that I feel will best defend against segment 367 and will oppose segment 367 legally to the highest court that I can and politically with all the resources I can get.

I was just interested if we could use the single pole and if we could work out stations on the fence rows or the property boundaries rather than the middle of the fields.  That would be my thought on it and I would be interested in seeing a plan on it. If it would be possible.

We are on the map as a possible route for your power line project. The location that you are proposing the lines on our property has a stream, wetland and woodland project.  We have spent countless hours and money trying to preserve this land and to keep it as pristine as possible. \n         There are species of wildlife on that portion of our property that are rare and endangered. Please see the attachment below provided to us by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. I have also attached a copy of our plat which should help to show you that this area should not be disturbed.  We have recently planted over 400 trees and entered into a Woodland program. Your project would eliminate those trees and disqualify us from that program and its tax and environmental benefits.\n        I ask that you take this into consideration and appreciate any feed back.  We only have the rear portion of our  property with the trees for our 3 kids to hunt and play,  just yesterday our oldest son had a camp out in that area with friends. This would completely take away the enjoyment that we have on this property. We love the outdoors and use ever part of our property. Please don't take this from our family, there is plenty of open farm land without disrupting what we have spent so much of our lives trying to preserve. \n       Again, I thank you for looking and listening.

The problem I have is grid line 199 is making a 90 degree turn due East of what will be our newly constructed home. This 90 degreee turn will require a tower and based on the current map will be placed within 200 feet of the front face of our home. I did not purchase this scenic property to look out my front window and gaze upon a 135 foot electrical tower which could pose a risk to my family. Our plan is to have this home construction complete by February of 2018. If this is the chosen route please tell me that this tower can and will be positioned farther away from my home than the map indicates. I would greatly appreciate a timely response to this matter as this is the second time I have inquired about this issue.

Box<\/b><br>272 Fawn Grove, PA  17321<br><br><br>Property Address: 857 Deer Road, Fawn Grove, PA 17321\nDear Sir/Madam,\nI have been retained by Mr. Kenneth R. Wright to communicate with your company regarding his significant concerns as to the possible location of an overhead electric transmission line on or adjacent to his properties. \nUpon a review of the information you enclosed with your letter to Mr. Wright dated June 1, 2017; he first noticed that the possible placement of the transmission line would be parallel to Deer Road (Rte. #2030) and along or near ponds and a creek. Please be advised that this placement involves an appreciable portion of land which is bog-like in nature and has previously been determined by Ms. Allyson McCollum of PA Department of Environmental Protection, South Central Region (2001) as \"inviolate\" in as much as development is concerned. I have enclosed some photographs which show not only the condition of the property, but also the location of ponds and creek on my client's property. \nHe is strongly opposed to this proposal and has grave concerns as to the impact of the proposed transmission lines on his property value. The proposed transmission line appears to transect the front of his property. The line will run between the front of his home and Deer Road which will significantly affect his property valuation. \nMr. Wright has 145 acres of farmland with a lovely stone home and many very well- maintained barns and buildings. The current market value of his farm is estimated to approach $2 million, if not exceed that value. Mr. Wright intends to retain all of that value and will fight for full compensation if you choose his location for these transmission lines. That fight includes appealing any decision to the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania. \nI would suggest a more thorough review of this possible location. I think your review will find that this location is not economically viable for your project.<br>7/7/2017","<b>Michael Frederick<\/b><br>2509 Country Road Chambersburg, PA  17202<br>tamsalter@gmail.com<br><br>We oppose Leg 329 which crosses our property.

I have an orchard at the intersection of frank road and burger king. From what I have seen so far the line will cut right through the peach and apple orchards. I realize this is open land and provides the easiest path of least resistance. Also your route cuts right through very valuable potential commercial property. Also I will have to remove producing orchards that are paying fifteen thousand dollars and acre. This land is good fruit ground and I wish to continue to farm for now. When I no longer can farm this land I wish to sell it for commercial development. The proposed line will greatly diminish the value of this land.

We purchased 3 lots that join the farm for our kids to build on and this line goes thru all three of them .

I have spent the last 27 years managing our woods to get it where it is now and I'm not going to let this take that from us. We do not benefit from any of this and it takes away the precious scenery that we have in our area. The map that was showed to use has the lines going overtop of my garage. We  do not want to raise our kids or grandchildren around this lines witch has said to produce EMF that could cause leukemia in children and problems with adults too.

The electrical radiation emitted and the chemicals used to maintain the area I believe are a threat to health and safety of the residents near by.    I also feel this would greatly impact the property value of the properties adjacent to 358.   I know you will say there are many variables that affect property values, but I challenge you to find an example of where property values went up or stayed the same after installation of the high voltage wires.<br>7/15/2017","<b>Charles Shannon<\/b><br>2594 Cider Press Rd. Chambersburg, PA  17202<br>ckshannon@pa.net<br><br>I appreciate the need for increased electric power.  I would hope the route you choose would be the least intrusive upon residential areas and farm land.  \nI live on Cider Press Rd, and I can see the Pugh farm across the beautiful corn field now growing tall.  Though there is industry on this approach to Chambersburg on Rt. 316, it is mostly hidden by trees.  What people see as they drive north on Rt. 316 is the village of New Franklin and then farm land with scattered homes.  It would be a shame to spoil this scenery with large electrical towers and lines.  Most of the approaches to Chambersburg are already heavily industrialized and commercialized.  This is one area that is predominantly farm land and residences.  It is quite a beautiful area.  Please don't spoil it.<br>7/17/2017","<b>George William Gardenhour III<\/b><br><br><br><br>Hi.

As it stands, Transource has proposed at least two routes that would violate restrictions on my farm and two neighboring farms- specifically, restrictions on commercial development as outlined by the York County Ag Preserve Board and The Farm and Natural Land Trust. Not only are these proposed routes contrary to the agreements we have with the County, State and the above mentioned agencies, they seem an unreasonable choice given the open fields and existing right-of-ways that would not require so much destruction.

Having to redirect some of our precious time we have left with a family member during their final days in this life, is distressing. Fearing you will assume it's not a priority for us to comment on your project if we don't. Although it sounds like it's a person issue just for us, it is not. It should be considered a personal issue to the whole community. Whether or not they attended the open house or make comment by mail. I am sure many are not even aware despite your mailings, etc. We did not receive your mailings until the week before the open house and just about assumed it was 'junk mail', as I'm sure many people did. Not a sufficient amount of time to alert the public about this. Regardless, here are some of the comments and concerns I have. \nThe electromagnetic field with its noise (very audible and disturbing) and how these transmission lines may cause childhood leukemia, miscarriage, birth defects, neurological disorders, other cancers, etc.  Don't discount it. It's the same as your project may decrease your electric bill. Oh, wait, save a couple dollars or effect someone's health. That's not the same. We have air traffic going into Hagerstown, MD Airport that follows the existing lines beside our property. And, there is other air traffic going north to south. These vary in altitude, but some are lower than others and they are perhaps heading into BWI?\nThe already existing poles & lines attract lightning 'zaps' but, your towering giants will do so even more. This will create a 'hot spot' for lightning to strike all around us. No thanks. \nYour project in this area will ruin the bucolic appeal of why we live here. This why we searched for our home. To be out away from development and the 'hub-bub' of town/city living. Hearing the occasional train whistle, not the constant humming of transmission lines. Eye pollution and noise pollution. \nAll the way ways and tributaries in this area are part of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed. \nThere are several farms on the preservation list in our area. We, ourselves, use organic gardening. \nI am praying you choose the route that is the fartherest east and south going to the Ringgold substation. That would be the one closest to the east of Fayetteville and traveling closest to the Route 64 and 418 intersection in Ringgold, Md. \nThere is also the property close to route 316 south out of Waynesboro that is, or was formerly, a junkyard operations that would direct over to the above mentioned study route of the route 64 and 418 intersection. \nI don't know how PJM determined to initiate this study to begin with. They don't live here and it isn't right to impose upon us what they think our needs are. \nMy prayers are that you don't bring this project. I am specifically praying you don't bring it to or close our area.<br>7/18/2017","<b>TROY  POSEY<\/b><br>38 piney hill road Airville, PA  17302<br>houndhunter@mtwirefree.net<br><br>(Submitted through WV Transource Project page)\nJust to let you know I am totally against this.\n(1) Could you please tell me who the consumers are that will benefit from this. From the metting we were at they told us that it will not benefit us at all.\n(2) Will anyone in York County receive any cost savings from this.\n(3) You say there will be a 600 million energy cost savings to consumers in the next 15 years, what happens after that.\n(4) Why are you cutting across from one 500kv line to another when a little further east of this both lines intersect. Why not go from where they intersect to where you have existing Conastone substation.\n(5) You say that the maps are not exact, Do you have some maps that show the exact routes that are being proposed.\n(6) What are the restrictions that will not allow you to cross property or obstruction that you do not want to deal with. (Examples) wet lands ,Cemetery's ,terrain etc.\n(7) Seems this is to supply more power to Maryland , since it does not benefit us. Is this were most of this power will be going.\n(8) What happens in 10 years from now and more people build will this be able to handle this or are they going to have to run another line then.\n(9) When under or near these lines will there be any static, shock, cracking from lines when wet etc. . I go to hook up hay wagons to tractor under some of the lines on the farms I work on and get shocked now.\n(10) Not all of the landowners that some of these routes go thru were contacted from you , two of my neighbors that I know of have not even heard about this. Shouldn't everyone that is affected by this know and anyone in the area should be notified, not everyone that has property in York county lives here.<br>7/20/2017","<b>Amanda  Scott<\/b><br>5420 Norrisville road White Hall, MD  21161<br>Ame.scott6@gmail.com<br><br>I would like to speak with someone in regards to this project.

My husband and I built our home on a family owned farm of over 100 years and I'll be damned if I will let anyone come in and take what is rightfully ours to do nothing but benefit the large energy companies.

For the past 2 years my boyfriend and I have been planning to build a house in the woods across from the intersection of Kennedy and Piney Hill Road. If this power line were to go in I would not want to live there anymore. It would completely ruin all of our plans that we spent so much time making. First of all my boyfriend has a PACEMAKER, and being that close to a power line would be extremely dangerous for him and could reset it or even shock him. If this were to happen it would be a huge liability on your company and even worse could cost him his life... We don't want to live at a location where we look outside and see a giant power line or hear it buzzing all the time. Also we will be having little kids in the next couple years and it is not a safe environment that I want them to grow up in. There are studies that show cases of leukemia in kids that grew up near EMS's. \nMy family's farm has been passed on for generations with hopes of everyone taking over the houses and building new ones. If the line goes this route it would make everyone in the future not want to live on the farm. Also there is a burial ground on our property, so the line can't go through there. \nSo to sum up my reasons...\n-It is a family farm\n-The line goes right through my house plans\n-My boyfriend has a PACEMAKER, you would be held liable if anything were to happen \n-Little kids will be growing up in the area\n-There is a burial ground\n-The buzzing will be annoying\n-The towers are ugly, we live in the country for a reason\n-The EMS's would cause connection problems\n-We will have farm animals, and the towers adversely effect them\nThese are just a few reasons of why this line should not go through our property.

Many of the routes that have been chosen have great impact to many private citizens property and lifestyles.  One of these routes runs directly behind my home.  My wife and I build our home about 3 years ago on a family owned farm that has been in my family for over 100 years.  We chose this area because it was free of things like transmission lines and in an area that would allow us to raise our family in a safe environment.  As I see this project will provide no real benefit to the citizens that you are going to take their land from.  Your potential $600 million dollars in savings over 15 years doesn't show anything about what the savings to the citizens of our community are going to get.  As I can figure it could be as little only a couple of dollars a month.  Since no one will share how many customers that $600 million is going to benefit.  I also find it very interesting that Maryland just passed a law that will go into effect in October that allows companies like yours to use eminent domain to take property for these projects.  Seems like you lobbied hard to ensure big business wins and the private citizen gets the raw end of the deal.

The Preliminary Alternative Route as shown below would impact the proposed mining permit because if would it would cut across land, owned by the Hess Brothers Partnership, that is being proposed as mining support area, Mining support area is vital for the operation of a mine site. If the Preliminary Alternative Route were constructed as shown, not only would New Enterprise Stone & Lime Co., Inc. be impacted by reducing the lifespan of the quarry, but the greater public would be impacted as well since local public  highways, roads, and general infrastructure are dependent on aggregate products produced at the Chambersburg Quarry.

The thought of your heavy equipment coming in and destroying the trees and forest floor plants, and the habitats for so many native animals and plants, is devastating. My husband and I have treasured this environment, with its quiet and natural atmosphere, since purchasing it and building our home here. It was originally part of a farm, and we were promised, with the restrictions on these lots, that they were not to be subdivided ever. And so, with that assurance, we never suspected that someone or some organization would come along and utilize and destroy parts of it for their own purposes. \nThe value of our estate is of extreme importance to us, for it is an asset which, when we downsize, will give us income for our future care. The changes which you plan would greatly deplete its worth and thus mean an uncertain future for us. \nOther proposed routes for your project do not appear to involve house lots so invasive, and would not result in power lines o two adjacent sides, as ours would. \nOur forested land is the only buffer we have between us and the existing power lines, and now you propose removing a large percentage of the trees, as well as constructing more lines, so that we will view power lines on two perimeters of our property, as well as on the neighbor's hillside. \nTo you this is just another forest which needs a swath cut through it, but to me it means a beautiful woodland trail, the call of the pleated wood pockets, a forest floor covered with ferns, and a peaceful place to walk as I unwind and collect my thoughts each day. Much of my decision-making is accomplished on my woodland trail. Many of our guests have enjoyed the trail with us. I cannot fathom seeing it ravaged and replaced by towers and electric lines. \nFor all of the above-stated reasons, and so many more, I feel that you should remove my property from your short list of probably routes.

Lines labeled 145, 144, 142, 155, and 157 would cause ongoing business damages from lost guest admission, fruit sales, bakery sales, pumpkin sales, tour sales and festival sales.\nWe have labelled the grass airfield we use for ultralights and helicopters in the normal operation of our crop farm. \nWe have labeled the pick-your-own fruit, pumpkins and Sunflower Fest sites. Each of these locations we use throughout a 3-year crop rotation practice. \nAll the above labeled wire sections will have a dramatic negative impact on our business income and the value of our attraction to the larger tourism industry. \nWhile there are other routes available, including an existing power line right of way and towers, there is no reason to create this negative impact on our farm, family business, and our tourism guests.\nThis farm's scenic beauty is our livelihood and therefore we will not accept an offer for a right of way across our land short of a decision by jury trial in York County or in the Pennsylvania Higher Court System.

The plan to just take the property of the individuals whose property you plan to use without their permission by using a new law that will go into effect in enough time for you project is appalling and no financial compensation doesn't make it ok. The people of the community do not want your money, they don't want anything from this project except for it to go away. It also makes it painfully obvious that there was a ton of lobbying that went into your attempt and plan for this project. Nothing like finding willing government officials who i'm sure were happy to take you \"donations\" in return for a vote in your favor. This project will in no way benefit the peoples lives, families and homes it will impact. The end result of you plan is to financially benefit the large energy companies. You will be taking away land from farmers, ruining the landscape, decreasing property value and putting family homes and the families themselves at risk by attempting to get so close to some. My daughters family in particular would be greatly impacted. You have a planned route to go directly through her back yard between her home and the tree line and it will run directly thru a corn/soy bean field. My daughter and her family built their beautiful home way back off of Norrisville road on a gorgeous piece of property that is a part of my son in laws family farm. This farm has been in his family for over 100 years and they built their home in that particular spot because of the view, the sunset, and most importantly the safety it would provide their family of 3 small boys. She has 3 sons, ages 16 months, 2.5 and 4.5 years old. These boys will be boys and having something like a high tension power line so close to their home and backyard is a recipe for something dangerous to happen. Not only that but the dangers and health risks that having these lines so close to their home is an unnecessary risk and one that they should not be subjected to. And yes i'm sure that you have your \"proof\" and \"research\" to defend that, but a large cooperation will always gather the information to benefit their cause while leaving out the objecting proof that could hurt their cause. Another thing that my family should not be subjected to is the humming the lines will give off as well as the risk of lighting strikes so close to their home and the transient shocks the lines can give off. If you choose to run between my daughters home and the tree line there is only approx 280 between them, and while I know that is \"enough\" space to allow you to do what you need to do that is far to close to anyones home. My family, daughter son in law and 3 grandsons are obviously the most important cause of my fight, but I am also concerned about the community as a whole. The same line that will run through my daughters property will also run closely behind Norrisville Elementary, Norrisville Library, Norrisville Rec Center and Norrisville Methodist Church. So the impact from this particular route will be huge. Im asking you to reconsider not only the project in its entirety but this particular route of travel and remove it from your list of potential routes. I will be ready to do whatever I have to do to fight and stop this project, especially if it is going to so closely impact my family.<br>8/2/2017","<b>Nicholas Eliason<\/b><br>2866 Sharon Road Jarrettsville, MD  21084<br>Nicholas.eliason@gmail.com<br><br>I am writing to express my concerns for you planned power line project.

One the proposed route will run within less a hundred feet of my sisters families home. route 150 is going to run directly behind my sisters home, the home in which she and her husband are raising my 3 small nephews. This will be in their back yard, and make their incredibly safe home, now unsafe. When the decided to build on my brother inlaws family farm we all questioned why she wanted to build do far off the road, and she said because its the most beautiful spot, with the best view of the sunset and because it will be the safest spot to raise her family. Its far away from the road, and allows them 50+ acres to roam free and be safe and out of dangers way. This proposed line will now change all of that, and the once safe place my sister wanted to raise her family will instead put her family at risk. Unknown health risks posed by the lines, potential for lightning strikes, risks of the trouble that 3 little curious boys could get into growing up with these towers and line in their back yard. Other dangers from it now being a right of way whenever the power company so chooses to drive back unannounced to a place where children are always playing outback. I also noticed that this same line runs incredibly close to the school and the rec council, the same rec council my daughter plays softball and that does not sit well with me either.

Waldorf, MD  20603<br>annempatterson@aol.com<br><br>I am writing to voice my opposition to Transource's plan to build an electric line through Shaw Orchards. My name is Anne Marie Patterson, but my maiden name is Anne Marie Shaw. I am the daughter of Glenn and Mary Sue Shaw, and I had the great good fortune to grow up on the orchard. It is a historic and beautiful location that has become a cultural asset to the community. My family has worked for generations to build the farm into a destination for families from far and wide to visit, to connect with each other and the land. Most other local family farms have gone out of business, but my brother and his wife have managed to build the business to the highest point in its history. When I grew up, we sold strawberries and cherries from a card table along the road. Now so many people visit to pick and buy fruit that the parking area grows to a quarter mile or more! One of the highlights of many people's trip to the orchard is a hayride through the gorgeous farm. Views like these our ancestors took for granted, but as farmland has been developed over the years, the experience is so unique that people come from as far away as New York, New Jersey and Virginia to enjoy our unspoiled beauty, as well as our delicious fruit.\nHow many people will continue to come if there are gigantic power lines overhead? Not only would they be unsightly, I'm sure there would be concern for the safety of the fruit. Regardless of whether it would be safe or not, there would be a question in people's mind, and that is all it would take for them to choose to buy their fruit elsewhere. We did our part, as a family, to preserve the agricultural future of the property when my parents sold the development rights years ago. The expectation was that the farm would not be developed and would remain an unspoiled agricultural area in perpetuity. Farming is a difficult, expensive business that does not always see the reward of the efforts made. Without fruit sales, the farm would fail, same as so many others in the area. \nI understand that Transource has its own business to run and power lines must be built in order to provide the power needed to its customers, but there are other options besides demolishing the beauty and economic future of a family farm that has faithfully served the land and the community for over 150 years. I strongly request that you pursue those options. \nSincerely, \nAnne Marie (Shaw) Patterson<br>8/7/2017","<b>Martha Riggle<\/b><br>12346 Johnstons Ln Mercersburg, PA  17236<br>mriggle@planetcable.net<br><br>One of the proposed routes for the new overhead lines would go through a community including Holiquin Riding Center.

My name is Anne Marie Patterson, but my maiden name is Anne Marie Shaw. I am the daughter of Glenn and Mary Sue Shaw, and I had the great good fortune to grow up on the orchard. It is a historic and beautiful location that has become a cultural asset to the community. My family has worked for generations to build the farm into a destination for families from far and wide to visit, to connect with each other and the land. Most other local family farms have gone out of business, but my brother and his wife have managed to build the business to the highest point in its history. When I grew up, we sold strawberries and cherries from a card table along the road. Now so many people visit to pick and buy fruit that the parking area grows to a quarter mile or more! One of the highlights of many people's trip to the orchard is a hayride through the gorgeous farm. Views like these our ancestors took for granted, but as farmland has been developed over the years, the experience is so unique that people come from as far away as New York, New Jersey and Virginia to enjoy our unspoiled beauty, as well as our delicious fruit.\nHow many people will continue to come if there are gigantic power lines overhead? Not only would they be unsightly, I'm sure there would be concern for the safety of the fruit. Regardless of whether it would be safe or not, there would be a question in people's mind, and that is all it would take for them to choose to buy their fruit elsewhere. We did our part, as a family, to preserve the agricultural future of the property when my parents sold the development rights years ago. The expectation was that the farm would not be developed and would remain an unspoiled agricultural area in perpetuity. Farming is a difficult, expensive business that does not always see the reward of the efforts made. Without fruit sales, the farm would fail, same as so many others in the area. \nI understand that Transource has its own business to run and power lines must be built in order to provide the power needed to its customers, but there are other options besides demolishing the beauty and economic future of a family farm that has faithfully served the land and the community for over 150 years.

Shippensburg, PA  17257<br>mhenninger@pa.net<br><br>Dear Sirs,\nIn regard to the proposed new power lines that are to be constructed just south of Shippensburg, PA, and because our farm is across the street from one proposed line (previously labeled #324), now the easternmost possible route you show on your updated website map, we are writing to express our objection to that route and to offer reasons why it would be better to situate the lines on the western side of RT. 81 with the substation on Rice Road, not Olde Scotland Road. \nThese reasons are as follows:\nThe new lines would be closer to Letterkenny on the western side of RT 81, and we understand that Letterkenny depot has expressed an interest in connecting to your new lines. Being closer to the depot would be a win/win situation for both your company and for them due to the nearer proximity. \nIf a route that is to the west of rt. 81 is built, you would not have to skirt the Blue Ridge Landfill on Orchard Road\nIf a route that is to the west of Rt. 81 is built, you would not be able to avoid governmental ground and parks, such as Caledonia, which have been expanding in recent years. \nIf a route that is to the west of rt. 81 is built, you would avoid the sand-based mountain land, and also the watery areas in and around Fayetteville, including Valley Quarry sand mines. The area has a sand base and it seems that it would be a poor idea to construct huge power lines on such a base.\nIf you do not build the easternmost line, you would also be able to avoid skirting Penn National Golf course, where President Clinton used to regularly play golf. It is said that the Hagerstown airport was expanded to accommodate Airforce 1, who knows, perhaps just to enable easier access for presidents to Penn National. \nWe highly object to having the new lines built on Olde Scotland Road and think that the above reasons are excellent ones to have the new lines situated on Rice Road and the Western side of Rt. 81, and will continue to work toward that goal.

My property is surrounded by pristine farmland, it's one of the reasons I purchased it, I wanted to live a life of peace due to a past life of suffering and trauma. With my property being directly adjacent to the current route, the total aesthetics of the landscape will be ruined, my quality of life will suffer, my property will be in the direct shadow of lattice towers, I will hear the hum of electrical current, wildlife will be disturbed, and my property value will plummet. I would like to recommend the use of the steel monopole structures instead of the lattice tower structures because they are less ominous and disturbing. I would also like to suggest and comment regarding route placement; why can't the route follow already existing infrastructure like highways, roads, and railways, more farmland should not have to be sacrificed. And, since the project benefits Maryland and DC, why can't it be constructed North and South in Maryland and connected to those substations, Pennsylvania landowners should not have to bare the burden to support other states, our taxes and utilities will not be reduced they will most likely increase because of the impact to our own local economy and lands.

This will totally devalue the farm property and #2901 (8799 Hades Church Rd).  It goes thru the entire property and shows the line extremely close to both houses.  Besides the financial destruction of our lifelong investments, we are very concerned about the effect on our health.  The high electric and magnetic fields (radiation) would be created so close to our homes.  Studies are inconclusive on this subject, however, some show serious effects.  SUGGESTION: continue the line shown along the east of Hades Church Rd (thru farmland) and then a right angle turn to connect to the line already proposed along Murray Road.  This route would not destroy the properties of 8797 and 8799 Hades Church Rd.

One of the proposed routes appears to go through the neighboring farm field, cutting through our little neighborhood of about half a dozen houses.  It is unclear to me why the route appears to follow the train tracks, and then veers into the farm field passing just feet from our house, then crossing through the farm fields across the street before joining up with the railroad line again.  Regardless, the route is problematic.  It is subject to flash flooding in heavy rain events coming down from the fields at Five Forks Produce.  The line also passes through some wetland areas on those farms.  Our house has a spring as its primary water source, should we or a future owner choose to put in a well on our 1-acre property, the drilling for a well could be complicated by having these electrical structures just a few dozen feet from the property. Additionally, from our spring house you can easily see the mouth of what appears to be a water cavern.  Presumably, knowing the limestone typography in this area means that there are caves, it would not be advisable to be drilling and installing such large structures possibly on top of them.  Our neighbors have well water.  Would drilling for the installation of these structures affect our water sources?  Not to mention, right where the line number \"336\" moves from the farm field to cross Clay Hill Road, there is a post there marking an underground gas line.  It's right at the corner where the properties meet.  Is it really safe to build such large structures in the same line as an underground gas line?  We moved to this area because it is rural - Comcast doesn't even serve this area (closest Comcast junction box is 3 miles away), and cell phone reception is spotty at best.  I know this line will need to go somewhere, but is there a route choice where such type of industrial infrastructure is already present, rather than crossing through a rather bucolic landscape?  I haven't been able to make it to community meetings yet, but hope to attend the next ones.

I own two addresses affected by this proposed project. My residence is 5631 Long Corner and I just months ago bought 5629 Long Corner as an investment for my family and my children's future. At the Open House yesterday I spoke with several representatives of you company about the project and had the opportunity to discuss my property specifically. My property was on Map U1 and the comment card I left was #4003. On the map of your project my property appears to be mostly on the 183 line and maybe a little on the 184 line. Your representative was very cordial and made notes on the map to correlate them with my comment card. I just wanted to clarify and add a few other comments that I thought of today. \nFirst, We bought this property (5629 Long Corner) with the expectation that our two children would be able to split it when they grow up and have the advantage of a place to build their own homes. Both of the hills on the property are directly in the way of the proposed route. My wife and I spent most of our Life savings  to purchase this property and these lines would drastically affect the decision of my children to build there in the future. It also will drastically affect any resale value of the property. \nOur property is not in agricultural preservation. No one out side of preservation buys farm land without considering that one day it could be sold to build on. This property is also land locked. The only route into it right now is through my other property. The only place 5629 Long Corner touches the road is a small strip across a stream and wetlands. To get to any Right of Way on this property the trucks and equipment would have to either come in off the Right of Way further up, Rip out all the trees lining the driveway of my residence then go down a steep hill and across my stream and wetlands, or the third option would be to come straight in off the road which would entail a stream crossing and wetlands also. This third option I actually looked into myself for future reference. It would take an environmental study and the Army Corp of engineers to build a suitable bridge crossing. \nFinally, I understand the need for critical infrastructure. However, I am not convinced this project fits this type of need. But it seems to me that projects like these should strive to stay as far away from residences as possible. Simply put. People don't like to live under power lines, Pumpkins don't care.\nThank you for considering my thoughts,\nJohn Arnold<br>8/10/2017","<b>Barry Diller<\/b><br>1284 Falling Spring Rd  Chambersburg, PA  17202<br>bdiller@nitterhouse.com<br><br>My Transource # is 2200.

For the past 47 years\nHoliquin has offered summer camps, year round riding lessons, horse boarding, birthday parties with pony rides, and girl scout outings. Riding\ncompetitions, 4H events and US Pony Club events were also enjoyed by our students.\nOur farm consists of the following structures: A historical brick home built in 1863, a historic stone bank barn built in 1811, a swimming pool,\na 30' x 50' bunkhouse with 2 bunkrooms, 2 bathrooms, a large dining room with a viewing area for the parents to observe riding lessons, and an office. \nWe normally have 25-30 horses on the farm. The horses are placed into groups; each group having it's own fenced-in field with water and a run-in shed for protection against bad weather. A stream (Marsh Run) runs through the center of the property the length of the farm. We use all 51 acres of the farm for pasture and for riding.\nOur students are taught horseback riding in a safe environment with the beginners riders taking their riding lessons in the indoor arena where there are fewer distractions for the horses and the riders. The more advanced students ride in the outdoor arena and in the fields. Our students learn safety around horses, responsibility and respect for others, skills, and as a result, they develop self-esteem. Our family and many persons who have passed through our camp and lesson programs have a special love for this farm as it was instrumental in shaping many lives.\nWe have taught hundreds of children from all over the United States and from other countries; among them are Denmark, Germany, Japan and France. We also have had an exceptional safety record with no insurance claims in the 47 years we have been in business.\nWe were very disheartened to learn that a utility company named Transource is planning to place 6 high voltage electrical lines on 135' towers across our property. This network will be located approximately 50' south of the outdoor riding arena, over our stream and through our adjacent field. Needless to say, the power line network would take away several acres of our pasture and riding area, and it would make our facility a potentially unsafe area for the horses and the children. Very few parents, including myself, would want their children riding horses\nnear, under and around high voltage electrical wires. I do not want my horses in the vicinity of these towers and wires, and my clients who board horses at Holiquin have also expressed the same opinion.\nThis proposed project would ruin my business of 47 years as I would have to close my doors! The property value of my farm would plummet and I would lose my retirement money from the sale of the farm which I have planned on for 47 years. I am a Registered Nurse and am aware of the potential dangers from overhead high voltage power lines and associated electromagnetic fields on humans and animals. My daughter is an attorney and will work with me to discourage this proposed project by Transource on my property.\nWe live in a quiet, peaceful neighborhood with each owner having 10 acre parcels of land. These owners are very distraught over the thought of this project coming through our land and bringing with it potential health hazards to children and animals as well as diminishing their property values which they have worked so hard to build.\nI DO NOT WANT THESE OVERHEAD HIGH POWERED ELECTRICAL LINES ON MY PROPERTY THAT WOULD DESTROY MY BUSINESS AND\nMY LIVELIHOOD.\nSincerely,\nMargaret E.

I believe that the deed is in the name of my wife, Jane M. Zaiger. Our property abuts Cold Springs Road on the east end of Waynesboro. \nThis property is located in the borough and contains a portion of Cold Spring Estates, an active approved housing development. As you can see from the following, this proposed segment cuts through the heart of the property to be developed, directly impacting homesites for about 104 homes. Of course, the indirect impact of this proposed line will be much greater and will drastically reduce the marketability of the remaining homes and the fair market value of our property. \nWe request that you take the above into consideration and if possible bypass our development property. \nSee attached for the segment that goes through the cold spring estates development. You can see the eastern portion of this development that is already complete. The area on cold spring road is an integral part of that development. We believe that using the proposed segment through the cold spring estates development would result in a major cost for ourselves, the borough of waynesboro and transource for the necessary easement hopefully this can be avoided by following the proposed segment 305.1 that follows the exisiting line right-of-way on the north side.

Also the home notated on the map and its existing out building are historic with construction dating back to the 1760's. \nOur major concern would be two things. The first being how close the lines would run to the house. If I understand correctly the right of way would be up against the existing power lines current right of way. That would mean the proposed line would be 165 feet closer to the house than the current line which would seemingly put the line closer than 500 feet that one of your representatives stated as the minimum distance the line would be from a residence. This land has been in our family for generations and I would hate to see our family home defaced with the addition of a hulking power line right in front of the house. \nThat being said, it is safe to say that no one along any of the proposed routes truly 'wants' a power line on their property but it is a fact that infrastructure does need to be built. Personally I would rather see this project's funds be devoted to solar or wind efforts than channeling the energy from updates fracking efforts but that is another discussion.\nThe second concern was that there was no one at this second open house that had clear answers on how the value of our property would be determined if we were chosen as a build site. Would the loss of usable land during the construction process be considered? How about the drop in property value due to a high voltage line being there? These are questions we would like answered as we would find it unacceptable to go any further with this process without knowing the specific verbage that would be part of this deal. \nFeel free to contact us at any time with further questions at 240-527-9354 (Ben) or 240-527-8885 (Lou or Mary).\nThank you for taking our comments and considerations.<br>8/14/2017","<b>Dianna Heim<\/b><br>6107 Greenbriar Lane Fayetteville, PA  17202<br>dianna66@gmail.com <br><br>Right of way process-who determines cultural & historic reviews-the PA Historic & Museum Commission?\nUF AECOM?

Enclosed are my concerns. \nI am writing to you concerning the proposed Rice substation 2. Since I was not invited tot he June meetings, I was anxious to attend the Open House last night. My neighbors, the Creters, the Singleys and Nelson Martin did attending the June meeting and wrote comprehensively about their concerns. I expressed my concerns with Jim Harrison last night. \nI live 2 corn fields from the propsed site and can see it from my house. Like others, I am concerned about the placement on the limestone ridge where I have lived for 39 years (the previous owners had to blast through the rock to build the house in 1973). \nMy concerns, in addition to what my enighbors related to you, are:\n1. The pole transmission line is preferable to the double circuit lattice both for aesthetics and practical land uses\n2. the construction of the substation will involve blasting through the rock ledge which will have an impact on my buildings and cause possible cracks in my house and garage. Transmission of the blast will reverberate through the rock\n3. I have 2 wells on my property and a 3rd in the fence row adjoining my property with Nelson Martin. The well water path may be effected by the close proximity of the depth of the substation foundation.\n4. The electromagnetic field of the existing power line occasionally transmits to wet concrete floor in my garage causing minor shocks. A substation so close may exasperate the situation. \n5. This ridge gets a lot of ice in the winter. Over the years I have learned to stay home when I have icy conditions which are not present in the houses below. Will you be able to navigate repaire trucks to the substation if necessary?\n6. There are nesting great horned owls and red-tailed hawks on my property. How will the disruption effect them?\n7. Hunters like to hunt int the area under the exisitng power lines. Will a substation be secure in such and isolated area?\nIn conclusion, it seems more sensible to use the Rice substation 1 location for ease of accessibilty, security of the substation and in my case, water stabilization and environmental disruption. \nI appreciate your attention and consideration in these matters<br>8/8/2017","<b>Delbert Kennedy<\/b><br>402 Catherine Street Greencastle, PA  17225<br>tkennedy402@comcast.net  <br><br>S 343 in the bend of the line north of 345 approved building lot with well.<br>8/14/2017","<b>David Becker<\/b><br>21028 Millers Church Road MD  21742<br><br><br>Line 316 is within view of home and will decrease property value.

For the past 4 years, we have been living in a small home, so that we would be able to afford purchasing land and building our home. Our hopes and plans are to build within the next year. The development of segment 333 would significantly deter these dreams for our future. We would be fearful of the consequences that these power lines would have on the health of our family currently living on the land, as well as, for the health of our future children who would spend time around these power lines, if they were built.

Do you have a guarantee in writing for us?\nHow much will the new line devalue our property and property of our neighbors if this line goes through and we have to see the line every day. Who would want to buy or build anything with this view?\nWhat about an electrical storm? Is it going to get hit with lightning as it is so high and what would the results. \nWhat happens if a line breaks and falls to the ground. What will the results be?\nWhat about stray voltage and noise of line? Stray voltage is a great concern as we have dairy animals on our property and it is our source of income. \nYou say you are going to use two types of poles so do we have a say in what type is used on our land?\nWhat do you do with the right of way.

Instead of initially presenting the information to everyone and allowing a question/answer period, followed by people then looking at the maps, people were split up with the \"divide & conquer\" mentality. \nNow as to the transmission line, we do not want it. It does not beneift us. The benefit goes elsewhere. What we will be left with is decreased property values and all of the health risks associated with living near a transmission line. According to an article published by the International Research Journal of Engineering and Technology, these are numerous: living within an electromagnetic field can cause short term health effects including dizziness, fatigue, headaches, nausea, and digestive disorders. the long term effects are much more serious - cancer, leukemia, Alzheimer's, abnormal cell activity, impairment of perception and memory, genetic defects, immune system deficiency, nervous system disorder, birth defects, miscarriages, etc.\nNo monetary compensation can make up for the loss of peace of mind which will be destroyed by living within an electromagnetic field with its possible health effects. \nSitting on the porch enjoying a gentle rain will be a thing of the past as the air will be crackling and hissing. \nWe just invested almost $100,000 in remodeling our house, which has a pleasant view of farm fields. this will no be replaced with an electric tower. Our property value will definitely drop- who wants to look out at that? \nOne of the reasons we purchased our property 26 years ago was because of the mature trees. We created a haven for wildlife on our property which will be all for nought if this line is built. \nOne of your representatives told me that electromagnetic field put out is no greater than that of my clothes dryer- but my clothes dryer doesn't run 24/7 so that analogy is worthless.

I am also concerned about the preservation of Harford County as an agricultural area. The state of MD and Harford County have taken great lengths to preserve farmland in the area, often resorting to agricultural preservation programs.

We are dairy farmers with stray voltage issues that we need to combat with and need an isolation transformer to control it. We have a high voltage line going within 800' of our property presently that could be the issue. Bottom line is and voltage and static do affect dairy animals by poor reproduction, loss of milk production, many illnesses, etc. the proposed power line is not within 1,000 feet so it may not be a problem. just mentioning it for considerations on other dairy farms. Would transource be willing to compensate for adding extra equipment to alleviate problems?\n2. Types of poles: Please use the monopoles for a. easier maneuvering around the poles while farming. b. better and easier weed and brush control. c. woodchucks (ground hogs) would love a 30'x30' habitat to dig and live in d. brush would eventually grow in those areas requiring cutting and controlling brush. e. to be fair to the farmers right away and damage compensation would need to be 3-5 times greater!\n3. routing of lines. For landowners and farmers it wold be more convenient to farm our fields and parcels if the poles would be placed on property lines for ease of maneuvering around the poles. Maneuvering around poles cost - loss of production, more opportunity to damage poles, etc. \n4. sinkholes in area of proposed lines. on my property that the area of proposed lines their are numerous sinkholes that have opened up over the past 20  years. What would happen if a hole would open up under a pole. \n5. Agriculture, a valuable resource in Franklin Co. The proposed route is thru agriculture lands, which is more valuable than mountain ground waste ground etc. It would make sense that it would be cheaper to build this power line thru nice farming ground, but is this considering the long term value of family in Franklin Co. Maybe it would be better to follow a mountain range. \n6. Maintaining right away. For myself I would like to maintain the weed control in the areas of the pole- reason we take pride in good - looking fields and premises. Maybe more compensation would be made up front for property to maintain weeds.<br>8/8/2017","<b>Robb & Tonya Fox<\/b><br>1873 Ragged Edge Rd.

The substation proposed will be visible and close to my kids new school that just had a monopole project surround it. The contradiction of Amish neighbors farming under power lines is very frustrating to think about and ruins, to me, a property that was studied endlessly to purchase on its specific location, moved from Maryland.

The transmission line would go straight across the center of these woods, and would take out 3 of our established hunting stands and take our a large portion of the woods.

My number assigned at check-in was 2322. I am vehemently opposed to the building of the Transource Independence Energy Connection. Even though the route doesn't show plans for construction of infrastructure directly on my property, the proposed route will affect both my property and my quality of life. I live in a rural agricultural area and the primary views from my house will be permanently marred by the intrusion of unsightly power lines across our entire field of vision looking East. Our view will be replaced by a new focal point consisting of thousands of feet of crackling and buzzing high tension lines and monstrous hideous towers. The character of the area will be forever changed. Our subdivision, Greystone Manor, consists of separately deeded estate lots. There are covenants on the land which include protections to preserve property values. One of the covenants is the requirement that all utilities be buried underground. The money I spent to bury electric and cable will be 100% pointless and wasted if Transource goes forward with the project. Further, my property will lose tremendous value because future potential purchasers will not pay Estate prices if a large power conduit runs adjacent to the property. In addition, and most important of all, is the fact that I have young children and animals, including cows, chickens, and a dog. I realize that the utility industry has a vested interest in claiming that EMFs generated by electricity transmission are harmless. According to cancer.gov, the truth is that the results are inconclusive at best. Inconclusive does not imply \"No risk.\" It means the \"jury is still out.\" In any case, I don't want my family and farm to be guinea pigs to test the effects of years of exposure. While researching the project, I came across the FERC filings. This is a \"market efficiency\" project. Natural gas power is cheaper in PA and utilities don't want to purchase power from expensive coal plants located elsewhere. It cuts into profits. Electric supply is constantly changing as new plants and technologies become available. In fact, Transource itself states that the project may not even be needed once it is completed. I would like to add that the graphic used at the open house to illustrate \"electrical congestion\" with lanes of traffic on a highway was deceptive, misleading, and omitted critical relevant facts. Using Transource's numbers...$600 million in savings, minus $320 million in project costs equals $280 million. Divided by 65 million people in the region equals $4.40. Divided by 15 years equals a total savings of $.29 cents per person, per year. NO ONE benefits from this project except the companies involved. In fact, simple supply and demand will RAISE rates in areas that were once cheaper. A 10.9% ROE to Transource will also add to the increase to electric bills for everyone. That's NOT a good deal. Unfortunately, property owners on, and along the proposed route will be the ones who pay the biggest price. Lower property values, potential health issues, disruption of our local area, plus the loss of the scenic beauty of our land, will all contribute immeasurably to the total cost of losses that affected landowners will experience. The Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776 set forth a Bill Of Rights which, states first and foremost \" That all men are born equally free and independent, and have certain natural, inherent and inalienable rights, amongst which are, the enjoying and defending life and liberty, acquiring, possessing and protecting property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety.\" This project, if built, will infringe upon my rights as a citizen of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and I will will do everything in my power to ensure that my rights are not abridged.

This right-of-way route would have a devastating effect on the Falling Spring Branch native trout stream drainage, destroy the scenic beauty of \"Stoner's Hill,\"  the highest point in the valley between the ridges to the west and South Mountain to the east and Civil War historic site.  It would also negatively impact one of the last 19 century woodlots and homes on Falling Spring Branch as well as two significant Native American archaeological sites on both sides of  Falling Spring Branch.  I urge you instead to select your proposed route 302.  Thank you for your consideration.<br>8/16/2017","<b>William and Carole Kirkpatrick<\/b><br>1678 Black Gap Road Fayetteville, PA  17222<br>bill@aeclakes.com<br><br>My wife and I (William H Kirkpatrick Jr. and Carole M. Kirkpatrick) own 4 twenty acre building lots in the current path of the transmission line. The current track will cross all four lots. Three of these lots are currently valued at $195,000.00 per lot. My personal home sits on the fourth lot and is valued at $740,000.00. I have worked my entire life to develop this parcel of land and plan to sell the other 3 lots when my wife and I retire in 5 to 7 years.  If the easement goes across our property, we will experience financial hardship. We will not be able to retire as planned and our property will lose significant value.\nCurrently the planned path for the easement crosses our property, as well as adjacent landowners. It is obvious from looking at the map that the planned path is going out of the way to avoid crossing the Michaux State Forest Property.  The piece of property that Transource is avoiding was in Private ownership five years ago and was given to Michaux State for FREE. Several Transource employees told us that it is easier to obtain easements from private landowners than it is from the State of Pennsylvania,  and that is why Transource is avoiding the State Property. I can assure Transource that this will not be the case!\nWe (Landowners along the Michaux State Forest Boundary) are forming a Coalition called The Eagle Rock Group. We have obtained legal counsel and are developing a legal team to protect our properties. Once our legal team has been finalized, Transource can be provided with a list of Lawyers. I can assure you that it will be more difficult to deal with The Eagle Rock Group than it will be to obtain an easement from Michaux State Forest.  \nThe easement Path through Michaux has several obvious benefits:\n1.\tIt is a direct route rather than a dogleg.\n2.\tIt is shorter, straight and would be less expensive to build.\n3.\tIt has less elevation changes to deal with.\n4.\tIt avoids crossing over and around Eagle Rock, a Natural Public Site. Access is permitted across private property to visit this site. Access to impacted portion of Michaux State Forest is also across private property. The closest public access is over 3 miles away (walk in only). \n5.\tThe timber on the Michaux property was a recent clear-cut and therefore has very few large trees to clear. \n6.\tAccess is easier due to existing logging roads built for heavy logging trucks.\n7.\tThe property was donated to Michaux for free about 2 years ago. \nIn summary, The Eagle Rock Group will be united in protecting our property values. I personally own 0.56 miles of the easement path. Nine acres of my four lots will be taken as a result of the easement. My wife and I are not interested in the money that would be paid for the easement. I can assure you that we will NOT be easier to deal with than Michaux State Forest. We are willing to delay the project for years and spend in excess of $100,000.00 to fight for our protection. \nWilliam & Carole Kirkpatrick\n1678 Black Gap Road\nFayetteville, PA 17222\n717-860-7984<br>8/16/2017","<b>Stephen Lanahan<\/b><br>3870 Henry Road Chambersburg, PA  17202<br>steve.lanahan@volvo.com<br><br>Locations submitted on Public Input Map<br>8/16/2017","<b>Stephen Lanahan<\/b><br>98 White Road Gettysburg, PA  17325<br>steve.lanahan@volvo.com<br><br>Locations submitted on Public Input Map<br>8/16/2017","<b>Matas Webb<\/b><br>109 Berkshire Lane Stewartstown, PA  17363<br>matasw@gmail.com<br><br>While our property isn't directly in the paths that have been proposed many farms we rely on are.

This directly impacts their ability to care for the earth and the land, but also it denies hard-working Americans their ability to earn a living.\nNot everyone is a fan of organic farming, nor understands the lifestyle of the Shank family. But through their farm and their outreach, they've reached many people and been able to share what they do with a large number of us. Because they care enough to share themselves in such a way, they create a greater understanding of modern-day farming and what it means to be a Mennonite family, breaking down barriers of ignorance. This is important work!\nIt would be a shame to lose the good work the Family Cow and the Shank family is doing on the land. Yes, electricity is important stuff. But so is a family's ability to work and earn and income.\nAgain, please do not choose line segment #323 for your new lines.\nThanks--\nSusan Helene Gottfried\nhttp://westofmars.com<br>8/16/2017","<b>Wendy Slafka<\/b><br>14710 Nicole Drive North Huntingdo, PA  15642<br>wslafka@comcast.et<br><br>My comments are in regard to Family Cow Farm - ID #2549 - Opposition to line segment #323\nI understand you are proposing to run a high voltage electrical transmission tower directly on The Family Cow Property.  I am opposed to this simply because it would ruin the ability of the farm to offer the kind of food it presently does.  Every other week, this farm supplies me with eggs, milk, cheese and meats that are organically raised.  Here is why this line segment would be totally detrimental to the continuation of the farm.  \n1. It is a well-known, accepted and easily demonstrable scientific fact that the AC current magnetic fields, which Extra High Voltage (EHV) transmission powerlines create, do in fact cause actual electrical charges/voltage to flow in and through objects, animals and people directly under the lines and out to at least 200 feet on either side of the power line. (See attached night photo of our family in a field where there is an existing EHV transmission line. These photos were taken last Sunday night, August 13th, at 10:00 PM. My wife and I and family are holding the florescent light bulbs. The voltage from the power lines is traveling 40-50 feet through the air, striking the upper end of the light bulbs, traveling through the light bulbs lighting them up with the voltage flow, traveling down through our arms and bodies to the ground where our feet complete the circuit.)\n2. Any conductor near the EHV transmission line, be it wire, pipe, rods, water or sheet steel can act as an 'antenna' to attract even more voltage flow than even what normally radiates from a EHV transmission line.\n3. The danger of actual electrical contact voltage (not just stray voltage) is increased proportionally with the height of the conducting structure. Would a 20ft tall steel building with a lattice-type, antenna-mimicking steel structure under the right weather conditions and in the right position ever attract a full power spark from the EHV line? I would not want my children or team or a customer or their children to find out. And I'm sure Transource would not want to find out either.\n4. Water is well documented to possess an extraordinary risk and attraction point for electricity. Almost all of our steel pasture structures for animal welfare purposes are connected to water 24/7. Our family and team is especially at risk in our mobile chicken processing building with all of its steel and water and people standing on wet floors and continually using water. The proposed segment #323 would pass within 100 feet of where this mobile processing building is normally stationed on butchering morning. This would be totally and ridiculously dangerous. Maybe even life threatening.\n5. Children and the general public visitors and customers are a daily part of our farm and pastures will be at extreme and unacceptable risk if Segment #323 is allowed to cross our farm.\n6. All animals, but cows especially, are extremely sensitive to electrical current. Even a weak current that is normally undetectable by people can be devastating to animal health and welfare. Just google 'stray voltage / dairy cows' if you are unfamiliar. Also see these links:\nIt would be the end of this wonderful organic farm that provides food for all of southern PA from the west to the east.  Please please reconsider the placement of this segment for the sake of all the people who depend on this pure food every week.  \nThank you.<br>8/16/2017","<b>Sarah PGreater Philadelphia Area Greater Philadelphia Area , PA  <\/b><br><br>speders3@gmail.com  <br><br>To Whom It May Concern:\nMy name is Sarah, and I'm from the greater Philadelphia area.

I am very disturbed by this proposal and strongly oppose it.   I have been purchasing delicious,  wholesome & organic food,  especially raw milk,  from this farm.   My family and I have benefited tremendously by switching to organic foods.   Since switching to raw milk my IBS is no longer a problem,  we have better immune systems (less illnesses for each of us each year).  My oldest daughters asthma has been almost non existent since consuming the raw honey produced at the Family Cow.   \nMy personal research has lead me to believe that there are dangers & risks of EMFs and steady voltage.

It appears to us that the expense of the real estate needed for the project is a small fraction of the project cost. It would only seem right and fair to the landowners involved to be paid in a generous manner with proper compensation that allows for property depreciation. We do not intend on signing any contract without having it reviewed by an attorney. Transource should expect landowners to be courteous and cooperative only if Transource themselves is willing to compensate fairly for the disadvantages of having transmission lines running through landowners properties. And always remember the golden rule-Do unto others, as you would have them do unto you.\"<br>8/15/2017","<b>Tony Caldwell<\/b><br>908 Blue Ball Road New Park, PA  17352<br>tony.caldwell25@gmail.com     <br><br>Proposal 166 Parallels our property within 500ft affecting what is an amazing view currently.

I am going to send an email from the website but I wanted to speak my mind  on this situation.  You are talking about a farm that is one of a kind.  In that neighborhood where you plan to go through or are thinking of going through is going to desecrate a lot of things -- there are so many people who buy from this person.  He is a unique person.  He is one of the few who does what he does. If you check into what he does, you would think twice about ever going and destroying it.   It is not just a regular farm with GMO crops.  This is a man who is doing  what his ancestors had done to create good, wholesome healthy food.  Now people are buying food from there because its one of the few places where you can buy some thing like this with no chemicals and in a raw state which is healthier than the pasteurized crap that you find in the store.  Please think about this long and hard and possibly find another area to destroy because that is what these companies do.

We are very grateful for these lovely people and their commitment to healthy, natural and organic farming.  As a certified health coach and someone who has been interested in natural health and wellness for many years, I have done a large amount of research into our farming methods and the impact modern, industrialized farming has on the quality of our food.  I personally have issues eating factory farmed meat.  Simply put, I can not digest it.  For several years, I was completely vegetarian because of this.  When I discovered well raised,  grass fed meat, I realized that a lot of the issue was due to the way the meat was raised.  I also object on many levels to the way conventional meat is raised.  While there are other sources of grass-fed, pastured meat available to me, I purchase from Family Cow Farm.  The flavor and quality is much better.  I urge you to try their products if you haven't had the opportunity.\nAs a cancer survivor, I only eat organically raised fruits and vegetables as well as animal products.  There is much independent research showing the effects of pesticide and artificial fertilizers on human and animal health as well as the reduction in the nutritional quality of the food.  \nI depend upon hard working, committed farmers such as the Shank family to raise food that keeps me and my family healthy.  Please choose another route for the power lines that will permit this family to continue their mission of growing the highest quality food possible without placing their family, visitors, animals and livelihoods at risk.\nThank you,\nMelinda Geiger<br>8/18/2017","<b>Willilam Nitterhouse<\/b><br>1130 Cider Press Road Chambersburg, PA  17202<br>wkn@nitterhouse.com<br><br>I attended the Town Hall Meeting at Kauffman's Station on August 8, 2017, and also the one held in June in Chambersburg at the Clark Center.\nI was disappointed to discover that one of your three (3) proposed routes (#328) will go through the area where I live. This residential area has two expensive homes (each exceeding 5,000 square feet each), and another is proposed. The second home is my daughter's.\nAfter looking at your three opportunities, I would think that your proposal #302, which references the far eastern possibility at this edge of Fayetteville, would disturb the least amount of residences.\nPlease give consideration Not to adopt your proposal #328, which would go through the middle of our properties.\ncc: PA State Senator Richard L. Alloway, II\ncc: PA State Representatinve Rob Kauffman\ncc: Rhoads & Sinon LLP - Harrisburg Law Firm -Tom Nehilla, Contact\nWm. K. Nitterhouse<br>8/15/2017","<b>Scott Pryor<\/b><br>13942 Poplar Grove Rd. Hagerstown, MD  21742<br><br><br>Hello, my name is Scott Pryor. I live at 13942 Poplar Grove Road, which is along the proposed option 310 route on the N3 map. From what I can tell from the two meetings that I have attended, I am going to get all of the negatives of this project with no benefits. Your proposal of following the existing lines will only end up putting a second power line along my property. Note that I said along, not on, so I will not be getting offered any money for the easement that you are required to have.\nI feel that placing a second line so close is going to increase the chances of affecting my health, and the health of my family and my neighbors due to the increased amount of electricity that will be in the immediate area. I know you can site studies that say it is harmless, but for  every study you find there will be another to contradict it.  Statistics are funny that way, you can interpret them to suit you purpose.\nAnother thing that I know for a fact is that another power line in the area is going to decrease our property VALUES. Honestly, who wants to be looking at multiple power lines running through their front yard? How many of you there at Trans Source live on properties that have power lines running through them? I'd venture to say there aren't many of you, if there are any at all, even though you work in the electric industry. You have told me numerous times there aren't any ill effects, that you have worked with people for 40 years and never heard of anyone being affected... I don't believe it.\nLastly, I am also certain that Potomac Edison is not going to lower rates just because you run another set of lines through. Those lines aren't for us out here where you are running them, they are for the people in more populated areas like Baltimore, D.C., and York. Don't think we don't understand why you are so interested in getting into Western PA. From what I understand, they are generating electricity from natural gas they are getting by fracking there, which makes it so much cheaper to produce the electric. When we asked why you won't just use the existing lines, you said someone else owns them. It doesn't make sense to run more lines; just upgrade what is there. Make some kind of arrangement with the other company. But I guess you won't consider that, since you won't make as much money as you would by running your own lines.\nMy preference is for no new power lines to go in at all, but if they have to , then they should be buried. They are around the cities, aren't they? I suppose you all don't want to look at them, it ruins your city scape... The only proposal that would not affect me would be option 313.  That route runs almost completely through farmland and would not affect anyone's health or property values like option 310.\nI feel like the bottom line is that you stand there at those meetings and say our input is valued, but you already know where you are putting your line and what we think is of absolutely no consequence. You and all the others stand to make too much money for what some guy that lives in the country thinks or feels to matter.  You city people always know better. We are always the ones that seem to lose out here in rural Maryland. Our health and property don't mean as much to you as getting millions of dollars and the city people getting the electric they need so much. It's all at our expense; we're just an obstacle to be stepped on. And frankly, that disgusts me. \n                      Page 1<br>8/15/2017","<b>Barabara Johncour<\/b><br>319 Woodvale Dr. Chambersburg, PA  17201<br>bsgjohnrow @yahoo.com  <br><br>No sense in running two major power lines within a mile of each other.\n-Upgrade existing lines\n-Add more lines\n-Expand right away to accomodate New lines. \nAvoid crossing the Falling Spring creek stream again- it is precious & beautiful \"Esp.

Note: Please email a short reply to verify that you have received this correspondence. edwin@thefamilycow.com \nGood morning Transource Energy Folks:\nI'm Edwin Shank, USDA certified organic farmer/land owner in Chambersburg PA. I'm writing to you about the \"Independence Energy Connection Project.\" Two of my sons and I attended your August 8 open house at the Kauffman Ruritan Club and Community Center where I was informed that my land owner ID is #2549. \nFor further reference, our 120 acre organic farm is known as Shankstead EcoFarm, home of The Family Cow LLC (www.yourfamilyfarmer.com) and is located at: 3854 Olde Scotland Road, Chambersburg, PA, 17202, which is in section C3 of the maps you had on display at the open house. \nI'm writing to petition you to please build the power line on one of the other alternative routes instead of your proposed powerline segment 323. If you do build on the 323 segement of the proposed route, you will do irreparable harm to our 5th generation business and will effectively shut down our family farm. \nFirst, it is important that you understand that we aren't unreasonable people. We do understand that Extra High Voltage (EHV) electric transmission lines are a fact of life. We seem to need them. We all use electricity. They are a necessary evil, we could say, of civilization as we know it. We are not opposed to powerlines in principle nor are we opposed to the Independence Energy Connection Project in particular. We are simply pleading that you choose another route other than segment 323. \nIt's equally important that you also understand clearly that our opposition to segment 323 is not simply a case of not-in-my-backyard (NIMBY). In fact, we just might be the only family you have encountered in this project who will be negatively affected no matter which of the three alternative routes you finally choose. All three of the proposed power line routes to connect the \"rice\" substation to lines south of Rt. 997 would run near of directly over properties that we own or rent for organic farming. \nFor example, the Northwest proposed segment/west of I81, (sorry I didn't copy down all of these segment #'s) would pass within 100 feet of a residential property that my wife Dawn and I own at 984 Pine Stump Road, Chambersburg, PA. It's where my son Winfred and his wife Brianna will live after their wedding this October 2017. We are not opposing this route. The Southeast Proposed Segment (the one that would run through South Mountain) would pass very near the home of our oldest son Rodrick and his family as well as another 100 acres of land which we are currently transitioning to USDA certified organic. We are not opposing this southeast route either. \nIn spite of the fact that both the Northwest and Southeast powerline routes are unappealing, unhandy, and worrisome and very certainly create financial hurt, we are not opposing either of them. They are, in fact, in our backyard and will negatively impact our family, but we are committed to be understanding, reasonable and above all respectful of the greater community's needs. \nIt is only segment 323 that we insist is undoable and unacceptable. Please try to be equally respectful as I explain why. \n1. For the last 10 years, The Family Cow's entire 120 acre home farm at 3854 Olde Scotland Road is fully occupied with multiple mobile, steel framework buildings and structures used for pastured meat chicken, pastured turkey's, pastured hens, pastured milk cows and management of young stock. \n2. We move the buildings/structures constantly to new fresh grass so that the animals move in a continual rotation to evenly cover the entire farm. This movement is absolutely foundational to our business. It is how we keep the animals eating and living on new, fresh grass. It's how we keep them moving away from yesterday's excrement. It is how we keep them healthy. The dairy pastured movement to new grass is our signature management method that mimics the natural ecosystem. The animal movement is how we are able to grow abundant green grasses without chemical fertilizer (a requirement for USDA certified organic). The animals fertilize the grass with their droppings. Some of the buildings we move twice per day, others only once per day and other maybe once per week. \n3. The smallest of these buildings are 12X24ft and about 12ft high. Others are 20X35ft and around 12ft high. Others are 20X40ft and the biggest ones are 20X60 with roughly a 20ft peak. Every spring and fall season, some of our boys and team climb onto the roof of the buildings to install or remove summer shade material. \n4. These mobile, steel framed, peaked roof buildings are equipped with water since most are used for pastured organic animal housing. One of the mobile buildings is used for our pastured chicken butchering plant. Every week throughout the summer we have 10-12 of our family and team working in this metal processing building, standing on wet floors and working with wet hands on stainless steel tables. Some of us are up to our elbows in ice/salt water to chill the chickens. \n5. The cows move 200 feet to new grass every day. And their drinking water tubs move with them. (A few years ago we installed roughly 3 miles of water pipe throughout the pastures on our entire farm to keep all of the animals watered properly). \n6. This is very much of a family farm including small children. We have several fathers that work here. They sometimes bring their children along to help carry feed to the chickens, gather eggs or help transport new chicks out to pasture from the brooders and in general have a good, healthy, safe, father-son/daughter time. They are all working in and around these mobile steel framework buildings and coming in continual contact with the buildings. \n7. Since The Family Cow is the highly valued organic food hub for 6,000 to 8,000 moms and dads all over the eastern seaboard, we get lots of visitors/tourists each year. We have a transparent, totally open-door 24/7 tour policy. Homeschool groups, mom's clubs and families...Dads pushing strollers and moms with a baby in a snuggly on their chests are a common sight on our farm. \nJust a bit more info for scope, The Family Cow...\nIs the #1 certified organic raw milk producer and marketer in eastern USA. We are #2 on the natiional level. \nProduces, sells and delivers on average: 2 million servings of raw, grass fed dairy per year...\nPlus 15,000 pastured broiler chickens per year...\nPlus 1,000 turkeys per year...\nPlus 40,000 dozen of eggs from pastured hens per year\nDelivers The Family Cow healing foods to 54 drop point clubs all across PA\nEmploys 30 full and part time employees including family\nHas an average of 4.5 million in annual sales \nProvides a marketing avenue for roughly 30 other small farmers, artisan bakers, gardeners, cheesemakers, butchers, orchards, fisherman etc all across PA\nProvides highly valued specialty healing foods to PA and 7 other surrounding states. \nHas a 14,000 strong, extremely passionate tribe of supporters all around the world (but mostly PA, MD, VA, WV, NJ, DE, OH and NY) \nIn case the reason and logic for our insistence that pwerline segment 323 crossing our farm is an unacceptable and unsafe move on Transource Energy's part...let me be more forthright. \n1. it is a well-known, accepted and easily demonstrable scientific fact that the AC current magnetic fields, which EHV transmission powerlines create, do in fact cause actual electrical charges/voltage to flow in and through objects and people directly under the lines and out to at least 200 feet on either side of the power line. (see attached night photo of our family in another of our organic crop field where there is an existing EHV transmission line.)\n2. Any conductor near the EHV transmission line, be it wire, pipe, rods, water or sheet steel can act as an 'antenna' to attract even more voltage flow than what normally radiates from an EHV tranmission line. \n3. The danger of actual electrical contact voltage (not just stray voltage) is increased proportionally with the height of the conducting structure. Would a 20ft tall steel building with a lattice-type, antenna-mimicking steel structure under the right weather conditions and in the right position ever attract a full power spark from the EHV line? I would not want my children or team or a customer or their children to find out. And I\"m sure Transource would not want to find out either. \n4. Water is well documented to posess an extra ordinary risk an attraction point to electricity. almost all of our steel pasture structures for animal welfare purposes must be connected to water all day and all night. Our family and tema is especially at risk in our mobile chicken processing buildings with all of its steel and water and people standing on wet floors and continually using water. \n5. Children and the general public from all over the nation and even other countries are an integral daily part of our farm and will be at extreme unnecessary risk if Segment 323 is allowed to cross our farm. \n6. All animals, but cows especially, are extremely sensitive to electrical current. Even a weak current that is normally undetectable by people can be devasting to animal health and welfare. \nSee links in attachment\n7. If segment 323 is still built...Transource is willfully going into this with full knowledge of the danger and risk and harm that will be done. \nSo...in summary and in short. \nWe are trying very hard to be reasonable and respectful in our request\nOur objection to segment 323 is not a (Not in My back Yard) NIMBY case. The Independnence Energy Connection  Projection will still \"be in our back yard\" even if Transource does not build on segment 323 \nThe risk we are highlighting here is not EMF or simply stray voltage. (Even through both of these are also concerns in their own right and may also need to be addressed). The risk we are highlighting here is contact voltage risk. The unique combination os steel framework buildings/structures and water which occupy the proposed path of segment 323 make it a uniquely unwise and unsafe choice. \nBecause we are now and have for years used our entire farm for farm buildings, and EHV power line cannot safely be run anywhere on our home farm at 3854 Olde Scotland Road. An EHV power line may not safely be run over existing buildings. Buildings that move are unconventional but do qualify as existing buildings. \nThis is a human life hazard and health hazard, a workman's welfare issue, and children's welfare issue and an animal welfare issue. Not to mention the destruction of a 5th generation family farm and the termination of one the nationals largest most valued organic, grass-fed food hub sources. \nPlease, let's talk.

I believe in supporting small business and Shaw Orchards is no different. \nShaw is one of the places where I have been going for the past 2 years with my boyfriend. This may sound like a cute date, but it is so much more. The Shaws and their workers are a welcome family. The property expansive and gorgeous, bearing literal tons of fruit: apples, peaches, cherries, blueberries, and more. As a baker, I value the opportunity to pick my fruit fresh from the vine, the tree, and the bush.  I friends visit our home in Maryland, we like to take them to Shaw for a day of picking fruit and picnicking nearby.\nI took my parents on a recent trip to the orchard and we crawled through the strawberry bushes on a Saturday morning, competing to get the best berries. One of the farmers was kind enough to stop and ask us how we were doing; had we found the best berries? He even pointed out a better row where we could be picking. While I appreciate a keen farmer's  eye for fresh fruit, I also appreciate the community relationship that supports both customer and owner.\nShaw Orchards is almost an hour-long drive from my home in Abingdon, Maryland. Wegman's is 5 minutes away. I am more than willing to make that drive to Shaw not only because of the quality of their produce but because of the care they show their property, and the kindness of their workers. The Transource power lines that are being designed to cross the Shaw property will change these activities. I will no longer be able to support a Maryland business that I have come to know and love.\nAs a current Maryland resident, and a long-time resident of Pennsylvania, it is my request that in your work on this project, you do what you can to avoid those power lines going through this 150 year old orchard. You will not just affect my peach crumbles and apple pies, you will affect the livelihood of a Maryland family and the future of a small business.\nSincerely yours, \nKelly M.

At the present time my hunting cabin is located on the property you propose to place an overhead electric transmission line. The placement of an overhead electric transmission line across these parcels of land would be devastating to the hunting for our family and to the integrity and value of the property. Also of concern is who would maintain the 130 foot right-of-way and how will that maintenance be performed? Currently 4-wheelers are a nuisance problem and a right-of-way would compound that problem. Also if you use the proposed route, you will run adjacent to Eagle Rock, a historic landmark to the area. \nThe proper route for the overhead electric transmission line in this area, is across Pennsylvania Commonwealth owned land and Guilford Water Authority owned land. This location would be the least disruptive to property owners and the public in general. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania owns hundreds of thousands of acres, and I am sure your transmission line will not have a negative effect on the public being able to find Commonwealth owned land to enjoy for recreational purposes. Take the time to obtain the necessary permits that are required to cross Commonwealth of Pennsylvania owned property.\nBased on the above concerns and the potential ruination of my property, I am requesting that your project NOT cross my property, and you pursue the necessary actions to locate it on Commonwealth owned property.\nYour consideration to this matter is appreciated.\nSincerely, \nWilliam C.

As a landowner, along with adjoining landowners that makeup a farm which has been in the family for over 70 years, I am totally opposed to the entire project.

I live outside of Philadelphia and am so grateful to have access to quality, organic locally grown food for my family.  Your proposal is an abuse of eminent domain.  I would imagine you have provided substantial sums of money buying whatever politicians necessary to approve your plan.  It is a disgrace that companies like yours are able to destroy so much in pursuit of private profit.\nIn this day and age of over-processed, pesticide and herbicide laden food we should all be protecting organic farmers everywhere.

Baltimore St.  Greencastle, PA  17225<br>Totsmom27@embarqmail.com       <br><br>To All Concerned,\nI have just become aware of the possibly of Transource Energy running high voltage power lines through our beloved Family Cow Farm.  I am writing to urge you to reconsider segment #323 and to choose one of the two other options as the path to run these power lines.  \nMy family of 5 has been purchasing our Milk, eggs, dairy, and meat at the Family Cow since 2008.  My husband and myself had both been tested for lactose intolerance and could not drink your typical grocery store milk without feeling sick and bloated, often accompanied by frequent trips to the bathroom.  That's when we finally decided to give the Family Cow a try after seeing their sign from I-81 for quite a while, always wondering exactly what raw milk was.  We highly value the ability to have such a wonderful place to purchase wholesome food for our family.  There are hundreds of families that come to the farm store to purchase their food and I am always amazed that Mr. Shank remembers me by name!  He and his family truly care about us, their customers.  The thought of them losing their livelihood and the dangers that would be posed from segment #323 running through their family farm is beyond highly concerning.  The thought of this breaks my heart.  Segment #323 would pose many deadly risks to the Shank family, their workers, animals, and customers who frequent the Family Cow. Segment #323 would assure the end of a valuable food source and would be a grievous loss to myself, my family, thousands of customers in the local community, and a large portion of the East Coast.  I would like to point out that we could NOT just go to another farm in the area and get the same type of organic, high quality food.  I cannot understand why segment #323 would even be considered an option, since there are 2 other routes available that would not force an entire family of 5th generation farmers to put an end to everything they know, love, and how they provide a life for themselves & employment for many.  Again, I beg of you to reconsider and to not strip us of such an important, life-giving source of food.\nRespectfully,\nKelly Hooper<br>8/22/2017","<b>Sharla Dunlap<\/b><br>8015 Hidden Valley Lane Waynesboro  , PA  17268<br>sesd8015@gmail.com <br><br>We, just last week, moved into a brand new home (see below) with an amazing view of the mountains and valley behind us.

I can see to my parents home where I grew up.  They can look down through the valley to the back of my home with an unhindered and awesome view.  I beg of you to not take this from us.  We have worked and planned and saved to build this home.  We planned the large windows, doors, and porches to take advantage of the surroundings.  This will all be gone with monster towers behind our beautiful home. People who visit comment that they didn't realize views like ours existed any more.

Shippensburg, PA  17257<br>mhenninger@pa.net<br><br>Dear Sirs,\nIn this letter I shall address why the new electric substation that you are going to build would be better suited to be on Rice Road, not on Olde Scotland Road. There are numerous excellent reasons not to build it on Olde Scotland Road, many of which have to do with the fact that the Olde Scotland Road site is bounded on the western side by interstate Route 81. \nThese reasons are as follows:\nSince the entire western side of the proposed new substation site on Olde Scotland Road is hemmed in by Interstate Route 81, there would be no room for future expansion in that direction. As you are planning on a 40 acre tract, which is huge and much more than a simple substation would require, it appears that you do have future expansion in mind, perhaps for a future electricity generating station, rather than a substation only. Obviously Rt. 81 will not move, so you would have far more freedom of expansion on the Rice Road site which has no such limiting roadway. \nSubstations and large electric stations are often situated in areas where they are not so visible. Due to the proximity and visibility of the Olde Scotland Road site, being directly next to Rt. 81, even with trees or some such screening, the substation would be still highly visible. \nSecurity of the substation would be perhaps compromised on the Olde Scotland Road site due to the proximity and visibility of the Olde Scotland Road site, being directly next to Rt. 81, even with trees or some such screening, the substation would be highly visible. \nSecurity of the substation would be perhaps compromised on the Olde Scotland Road site due to the proximity of Rt. 81, and since our country seems to be shifting to becoming less and less secure as the world witnessed just a few days ago in Charlottesville, security should be concern, one would think. The Rice Road site is more removed, and also would not be visible, from Rt. 81. As they say \"Out of sight, out of mind\" \nEase of accessibility for your maintenance equipment in the future would possibly be limited on the Olde Scotland Rd., site due to Rt. 81. It would not, presumably, be possible to get large pieces of whatever equipment might be needed around the entire perimeter of the site on Olde Scotland Rd. There would be no such limiting factor of any type on the Rice Road site. \nNatural disasters, such as mini tornados, perhaps better named whirlwinds,  have occurred on this side of Rt. 81 along Olde Scotland Road. On our farm we have had trees ripped out and also had small shed flipped. Another time a nearby farmer on Olde Scotland Road  had part of a torn off, and lost several trees. Since this area has experienced this type of weather disaster in the past, and more than once, it is only logical to expect that it will happen again, and if a twister hit your substation and pieces from that substation were to end up on Rt. 81, thousands of motorists could be endangered. This stretch of highway, we are told, is the second most busy truck thoroughfare in the country, being only second, evidently, to a stretch of highway near Chicago. No such endangerment of the public exists on the Rice Road site since it is not bounded by Rt. 81. \nHand in hand with the above point, another concern is due to the lay of the land along Olde Scotland Road, with hundreds of acres of open ground which create not only mini twisters, but also sweeping, unbroken winds. A visiting architect once told us that this area along Olde Scotland has a huge amount of \"fetch\", as wind collecting ground is evidently called. Like tornados, high winds would have a negative impact on your site. Rice Road, however, is totally different with smaller fields, a few slight hills, and no huge open areas. \nAnother possible problem is flooding. Not that many years ago, in 2007, there were some abnormally heavy rains which caused flash flooding that crossed Olde Scotland Road not far from your proposed site, and washed over Rt. 81. The flooding shut down Rt. 81 and even moved the giant paint can, at A&A Decorative Design, off its base. Due to the fact that the land slopes from South Mountain towards Rt. 81, the large and unexpected amount of rain all headed toward Olde Scotland Road. No one would have believed it, but we all saw it happen. Flooding would have to be a very bad thing, and a huge safety concern, for a substation. Rice road should not have this issue. \nThere are far more people and even the Links Golf Course on the Olde Scotland Road site. It would be a rare occurrance, but there certainly exists the possiblity of a stray golf ball going through the equipment and perhaps causing damage in the substation. No such issues, and far fewer people, are on Rice Road. \nWe highly object to having the new substation built on Olde Scotland Road, of course, and beside that, we think that the above reasons are excellent ones to have the new substation situated on Rice Road, and will continue to work toward that goal.

The whole concept of organically raised or produced means raised without man-made chemicals or devices that would alter the natural, normal and healthful life style under which these animals are raised.\n  I am unable to drink dairy products produced and sold in our local stores without taking enzymes and supplements to enable me to digest them.

When it rains, you can hear the cracking and sizzling of the energy going through and into the rain drops around you. When it's not raining, you can still feel the energy on your skin.  Organically raised animals need calm, quiet, and natural environments and conditions to produce their healthy, healthful foods.  Under these conditions of being under a power line, cows have been documented as producing less milk because of the unsettling atmosphere or environment.  Also, I understand that the metal structures and water used in his productions could become conduits of stray power, striking the animals as well as any of the many humans working on his farm or shopping at his store. \n  Please reconsider and use another route other than this #323 line segment that goes directly over the majority of Mr. Shank's farm.

Our farm is in the path of one of the routes and if built as shown, it would ruin our woods, pasture, large field and potentially three spring heads.  The line comes from the neighbor's right through a spring head and creek into our pasture very close to another spring head, then into our woods near another springhead, making a turn and running the full length of our eight acre crop field ( only a few hundred yards from the houses on the property).\n  In addition to the disturbance of the woods, pasture and field we are concerned with interference in radio and other receptions.  A very real concern is the size of the towers and the 130 ft. right of way. The pole type towers would take less field and pasture space than the lattice towers, but the right of way is particularly disturbing to the woodland. I am now contracted for select timber cutting and such a right of way would decimate the wood's beauty and future wood harvest. \n  We just had new tower lines installed just west of our property. If more lines are needed why not use those existing towers?  The beauty and land use of our farm would be greatly impacted as well as potential water source problems.

Reference #8012. \nThis property which is located on 15052 Wingerton Road, Waynesboro, PA is owned and operated by a family who purchased it in 1970 for the sole purpose of establishing a facility for children to learn to ride and care for horses in a safe and caring environment. For the past forty-seven years Holiquin has offered summer camps, year round riding lessons, horse boarding, birthday parties with pony rides, and girl scout outings, riding lessons and badgework. Riding competitions, 4H events, U.S. pony club events were also enjoyed by our students. \nOur farm consists of a brick house built in 1863 and a large bank barn built in 1811. In front of the barn is a large bunkhouse/indoor arena complex with 2 bunkrooms, 2 bathrooms, a large dining room with a viewing area for the parents to watch riding lessons, and an office. The indoor arena is 70'x150'. Approximately 50' from the indoor arena is a 150'x300' outdoor arena followed by a pasture field and large run-in shed. \nWe normally have 25-30 horses on the farm with the horses placed in small group,s each group having it's own fenced-in field with water and a run-in shed for protection. A stream (Marsh run) runs through the center of the property the length of the farm. We use all 51 acres of the farm for pasture and for riding. \nOur students are taught horseback riding in a safe environment with the beginners starting their riding lessons in the indoor arena where there are fewer distractions for the horses and the riders. The more advanced students ride in the outdoor arena and in the fields. Our students learn safety around horses, responsibility and respect for others, skills, and as a result, they develop self-esteem. Our family and the many persons who have passed through our camp and lesson programs have a special love for this farm as it was instrumental in shaping many lives. We have taught hundreds of children from all over the United States and from other countries, among them Denmark, Germany, japan, and France. We also have had an exceptional safety record with no insurance claims in the 47 years we have been in business. \nWe were very disheartened to learn that a utility company named Transource is planning to place 6 high voltage electrical lines on 135' towers across our property that will be located approximately 50' south of our outdoor riding arena, over our stream and through our adjacent field. needless to say, this power line network would take away several acres of our horse pasture  and riding area and it would make our facility a potentially unsafe area for the horses and the children. Very few parents, including myself, would want their children riding horses near, under and around high voltage electrical lines. I do not want my horses in the vicinity of these towers and wires, and my clients who board horses at Holiquin have also expressed the same opinion. \nThis proposed project would ruin my business of 47 years as I would have to close my doors! The property value of my farm would plummet and I would lose the retirement money from the sale of the farm which I planned on for 47 years. I am a Registered Nurse and am aware of many of the potential dangers from the overhead high voltage power lines and associated electromagnetic fields on humans and animals. My daughter is an attorney and will work with me to discourage this proposed project by Transource on my property. \nWe live in a quiet, peaceful neighborhood with each owner having 10 acre parcels of land. These owners are very distraught over the thought of the project coming through our land and bringing with it potential health hazards to their children and animals as well as diminished their property values which they have worked so hard to build. \nI do not want thee overhead high powered electrical lines on my property that would destroy my business and my livlihood.<br>8/25/2017","<b>John Koons<\/b><br>10789 Five Forks Road Waynesboro, PA  17268<br>kns19612@yahoo.com    <br><br>Dear Sir/Madam,\nI am a landowner with property situated in Antrim, Quincy, and Washington Townships, Franklin County, Pennsylvania. I am writing in regard to the proposed 230Kv electric transmission line that has numerous alternative routes identified across Franklin County, Pennsylvania. My farm have been enrolled in the Franklin County Agricultural Land Preservation program since its inception. I preserved the very first farm in Franklin County. The proposed transmission line will affect most of my property enrolled in the Preservation Program. I would like you to know that we enrolled in this program voluntarily to protect our property from development so future generations could farm this productive land. We were well aware that the property could only be used for agricultural purposes and were very agreeable to those conditions. \nNow, it seems that it is possible that a private for-profit company we come in and construct large intrusive towers and place an easment on this property that was intended to remain productive agricultural land. If you are unfamiliar with the project. Please go to the following link on the internet to get additional information. http://www.transourceenergyprojects.com/IndependenceEnergyConnection/\nI recently attended one of the presentations provided by Transource and was given information that greatly concerns me. At the meeting we were told that this project is not governed under the Federal Energy Resource Commission (FERC) but rather will be given approval by the Public Utility Commission (PUC) and further more will not have to go through the Pennsylvania Agricultural Lands Condemnation Board for approval. We are very concerned as this proposal is being presented by a private for-profit comapny that stands to gain economic benefit while we lose valuable resources here in Franklin County. The landowners could be affected by eminent domain if this private for-profit company is given approval by the PUC. According to Transource, the landowner would only be entitled to a one-time compensation for a 130ft right-of-way easement through their property that would include 135ft lattice type towers that each consume a 30X30 section of land that would be taken out of agricultural production. Additionally, we were told that once the easement is in place and the towers are constructed that we, the landowners, would be responsible for the taxes on this eased property where the power line would traverse. I do not believe that it is fair and equitable to the landowner as the towers have the potential to take significant amount of land out of production. An alternative to these large lattice type towers was presented at the meeting. A less intrusive monople could be constructed but Transource stated that they are more expensive and unless the PUC mandates them to do so they will not construct the monopoles because of the cost. \nAs participants of the Agricultural Land Preservation Program, we are not allowed under the governing law to take lands out of production so I ask, why is a private for-profit company allowed to do so?\nWe understand that upgrades to the existing electrical grid are needed. However, the local landowners and residents affected by this should benefit in some way and the planners for this project should make every effort to avoid preserved lands where federal, state, and local tax dollars have been expended. I am requesting that as a representative of your constituents that you express these concerns and see that this type of project does not have a  negative impact on our community and the landowners who own property here.<br>8/10/2017","<b>James C & Mary G HollandP.O.

Not only do I ask that you choose an alternate route but at minimum an aternate pole option.  The large lattice type poles are the worst possible option.  Is there an underground possibility in our short half mile section?  I've seen were you've added much more lines to a route to avoid a proposed residential neighborhood.  That must cost significantly more then our request for underground, or at the least the single monopole.  The part that irritates us the most is we will not see any compensation for our decrease in property value, such as a decrease in power price, because this line will not service our area.  The only people who benifit, if that's what you call it, are those who you'll pay a minimal fee for a right of way.

I was reading that and I found it quite disturbing.  Transource found things to be dangerous and are not permitted in relation to what you nicely call \"nuisance shock\".  which I find humorous because a shock is a shock and especially if we are talking about animals, like hens and chickens which they would be continually shocked every time they tried to eat or drink.  Nuisance is wrong word.  Found it to be interesting about how their life would be in that environment.  Anyway, I found it interesting, very revealing that ...(incomplete)... Had a question about so let's say the power line does cross our property.  So I had a question about the shock on our vehicles.  the encouragement rule so it would be unadviseable probably even illegal so if we moved our structure under those power lines.  So there will be a large portion of our land that we could not use from a legal standpoint.  So we would have unuseable parts of our farm and I wanted your opinion on that.  Very last thing:  Also had another question about the 52 ft trailer and 30 ft school bus.  These structures are almost identical to the structures we have on our property.  And the ___(incomplete...) bldg is 30 ft long.  Rain shelters for the pastured chicken are 35 ft long.  Very interesting to say that all the bldgs are very similar to what exists on our property.  Coincidental to what we have and almost identical I know the length is important to the amount of energy/power.

The plan proposes that 135 foot double circuit lattice towers be placed approximately 500 feet apart across Maryland and Pennsylvania. The proposed route 329 would span approximately 2,500 feet of our property. \nTen years ago we began a search for a very unique property positioned close to town but large enough to provide privacy as well as accommodate future generation. Our goal was a  historic farm house we could renovate. Six years ago we purchased our 60 acre property and invested heavily to make it our life long residence. Our historical farm house is dated back to 1790 making it one of the older original limestone farm houses in the area. We have laid out additional lots on our farm to be gifted to our two sons to build their homes and raise a family. \nRoute 329 would be directly out our front door.
