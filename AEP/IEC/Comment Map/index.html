I purchased my 77 acre farm property in 2011 with 3 building lots (A-B-C) included on the property. These lots are currently located along the Fairfield Rd. side (West) of the farm. I received approval from Hopewell Township in 2014 to relocate these lots to other areas on the farm. Lot \"A\" is to be relocated to the east side of the farm just to the northwest of the existing 1 acre pond. This would put lot \"A\" directly below proposed line segment #182. Remaining lots \"B\" and \"C\" are to be relocated to the East side of the property in the woods at the southeast corner of the property. Lots B-C would be in direct proximity to proposed line segments #181/#183. In addition, proposed line segment #182 traverses a path across my property that essentially cuts the property in half. Also, lines #181/#183 are in direct conflict with environmentally sensitive areas at my pond and wetlands/stream area beside the wooded area near relocated lots \"B\" and \"C\".

I did not attend the meeting not because I did not care but because I was not aware of it.  Several months ago, I was fully aware of the fact that some entity of the power company was going to be on my property to cut trees and spray chemicals.  I was aware because they sent a live person to my front door that made contact with me.  When I learned by the foreman that the trees they cut into 300+ pound sections were within the boundaries of the \"agreement\", I was astounded and invited him to help me move them even though \"It is my problem and not theirs\".   The manner that this \"meeting\" was announced was absolutely unacceptable, and in my eyes, sneaky.  I am sure it was thrown away with the piles of \"junk\" mail received.   \nMy wife and I purchased this HOME on approximately 2.26 acres because of the beauty of the home itself, the land it is on, and the view it provides.  When I learned that there are plans to potentially build a 30Ftx30Ftx135Ft tower smack dab in the middle of the yard my young children and I play in, I immediately felt my heart skip a beat and my face turn red.  I realize that our home is not a million dollar mansion, but it is our home and we work extremely hard to be able to afford it.  A monstrosity of an electrical tower in the middle of our front \"play\" yard will undoubtedly reduce the value of our house.  The potential HEALTH RISKS that this tower would bring is not something that I want at all!  No amount of money paid is worth the safety and health of my family to include my TWO SMALL CHILDREN.  \nAlthough the limited information on your website says that it will reduce costs of electric, I maintain that no amount of energy cost savings is worth a compromised view, damage to a DNR maintained trout stream, lowered property values, and HEALTH of my CHILDREN.  Please consider alternate routes or take the millions of dollars that this project will cost and apply a small amount to everyone's monthly bill.  I know that there are studies that say that electrical towers do not affect health but I also know there are studies that say there IS a direct correlation between power lines and health problems ESPECIALLY young children.  The Courts tend to agree with my assessment.  If this company needs testimony to this fact, they can reach across the country and ask Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) who is now $333 million dollars poorer since their 1993 court case.\nI promise you that the aforementioned sentence is by no means a threat.  I will, however advise you that my wife and I fight every day for what is just and right in this world.

Ash Lane Shippensburg, PA 17257<br>Bearlin@pa.net<br><br>Further comments-in addition to those filed in person, June 13, 2017 regarding segment 381 of proposed powerline \"Independence\" and the western substation site.\nA primary concern is the continued quality of living for the persons residing along this segment. Currently twenty family dwellings are closely tied to the water provided by the aquifer underlying the land along this short mileage segment. One quarter of these families depend on livestock related agriculture to provide income and require large water volume to continue to be viable. Well depths vary from 50' to 500' from personal communications with the residents.  Water flow rates are also variable. \nFrom past history along this Rice Road corridor, from Pine Stump Road to Mount Rock Road, any drilling for additional wells for new home well for drinking water or geothermal wells has resulted in water disturbances up to and including dry wells being reported. The soils are from the Hagerstown and Ryder soils groups and the associated steeply inclined Zullinger limestone formation. This formation transmits water via fractures in the rock and is sensitive to disturbances. Bedrock is exposed. Surfaces are steeply sloped and underlain with karst formations, succeptible to sinkhole formation. Information is from the Franklin County soil survey Aug 1975, maps 29 and 35, and other sources online, such as PASDA, as well as personal communications with residents. Any drilling into for tower anchoring or levelling of this area for the substation would likely be a detriment to the water sources for these residents. Any reduction or elimination of water sources would significantly affect in a negative way the livlihood of numerous residents.\nAlternatively, The proposed substation site east of I81 would be on more level strata of Murrill gravelly loams. These soils are deep with greater depth to bedrock and formed from colluvial sandstones and shales. Excavation, grading and tower installation would find less exposed limestone outcrop.\nCrop land providing feed for two dairies and additional heifer raising herds, chickens, an orchard, pasture and browse for a natural fiber farm and established plantings for a tree farm are located immediately adjacent to or directly under the proposed segment 381 or the proposed Rice substation site lying west of I81. Effects to cropland production, silviculture, pasture and browse would adversely affect residents' livlihood if acreage available were reduced, altered in erosion capacity, destroyed or contaminated by invasive species brought in on construction equipment.\nThis immediate region is also steeply sloped and provides ground cover, wildlife transit corridors and windbreak to the homes lying east of the proposed right of way vegetative cutting, i.e. We would lose our winter protection of homes and field plantings arising from storms right in front and downslope from our homes. Our farm would lose afternoon shade of pasture and livestock. Removal of vegetative cover could change local microclimates.\nAlong the 381 segment within the right of way proposed setback is an existing high tensile electrified pasture fence acquired through a grant with PA DCNR Project Grass. this fence must be maintained in agreement wilth the grant requirements. It cannot be removed. Although small, this pasture is maintained using rotational grazing and we adhere to best management practices for the steeply sloped area, in fact we were aproved for steeply sloped pasture criteria in the early 2000s by USDA. Erosion from ground disturbance would be a problem on this steeply sloped land if ground area is disturbed near fencing. Residual effects from high voltage may affect performance of pasture fencing.\nOur farm uses no herbicide or pesticide application to fields pasture, gardens and woodlots and would lose production browse and pasture if spray drifted from maintenance along this segment. \nOur farm is registered and approved as a PA Preferred agricultural producer of wool, cashmere and alpaca fiber. We have worked years to improve genetics in the herd and flock to make possible a product entirely derived from Pennsylvania sources in growth, harvest, milling, spinning and garment fabrication. Losing our pasture through changes to forage growth would cease production. One farm would be lost from PA Preferred status.\nSeveral resident families harvest deer and other wildlife, fruits, nuts and berries in the immediate area of segment 381 covered by forest and field. This food source would be affected by any sprays or cutting of the right of way. \nSo far I've addressed water supply, food production, farming, microclimates, wildlife. Let's introduce one remaining concern- money. The Transource Company states repeatedly in its local public relations notes that this new Independence Transmission Connection will save \"the people\" $600 million in electric costs over 15 years. Which people? \nThe residents along segment 381 have farms, homes and acreage that may be the ONLY source of income in their retirement, or in sales possibilities as income for their children in this lifetime. Devaluing our real estate is an up front, immediate fallout from the 15 year projected benefit to the \"electric consumer\" . The white paper detailing the project seems to overlook real effects to the closest contact people.\nThe bottom line here is company costs and profits. Segment 381 is a straight line from point A to point B, the Rice substation. It may look to be low in company cost, but from the residents' view, the cost is extremely high. The addition of this segment's visual impact, right of way restrictions, potential adverse effects to water supply, soil production, crops , trees, wildlife, livestock and persons living and working near it will not improve the nearby residents' income or reduce their electric costs over 15 years. The impact to this little group of twenty families would be significant- in an adverse manner.\nI respectfully ask you to consider these comments when deciding the route and substation location.

The maps presented on your website and in your mailings were not detailed and many residents of the Norrisville/Jarrettsville area were unaware that your proposed line routes would cross their properties.  Your mailings were not made in enough time and were also not detailed enough for residents to make informed comments at the June 7 meeting.  \nI submitted my comments then but after further consideration have more to say, particularly about your proposed line Segments 118 and 120.  These two proposed segments pass through a subdivision known as \"Nestling Winds\" which is more densely populated than the surrounding countryside. It contains about ten 10 acre parcels, each with houses, barns, and other outbuildings.  On these small properties the installation of 135 ft towers with electric lines and service roads would be unfairly disruptive to residents.  In addition, there is a public safety concern associated with the installation of towers on these small holdings.  Assuming that towers would be required where line segment 120 changes direction, a tower would be installed on the property of Harford Co. Councilman, Chad Shodes.  He and his brother, Tim, are the parents of at least 3 young children.  Similarly, a tower would be constructed on the southern edge of the property of Laurel Smith Woodall very close to the homes of Allen McElwain Jr. and his brother Ben.  A total of 5 young children live in those houses. Proposed line segment 118 also crosses close to the house and buildings of Ernie McElwain, who is the father of 2 young children.  We hope you will agree that the proposed line segments 118 and 120 cross an area that is too densely populated for the safe construction or operation of your lines.\nThere are other important considerations.  One is the preservation of some of the best argricultural lands currently under cultivation in Harford Co. The surrounding farms of Allen McElwain Sr. and Ernie McElwain are both in the Ag Preservation Program. The farm of James Wiley and Pond View Farm on Jolly Acres Rd. are under cultivation and are also important agri-businesses in the area. Another concern is the preservation of the numerous ponds and streams in the area which drain into Deer Creek.\nThe Norrisville/Jarrettsville area is in the process of organizing resistance to the construction of Transource power lines in the Harford Co. part of the East Study Area. Residents and elected officials are meeting tonight to exchange information and sign petitions urging Transource to adopt line routes north and west of Norrisville in the more open country of Balto. Co. and Pa.  These petitions will be sent to you and to Harford Co. elected officials and government agencies.\nThank you for your polite attention to our concerns.

No notice was sent to my house regarding a public meeting on June 7th. I just found out about this today. I am mainly concerned about proposed \"Line 120\" on AEP East Over as I just purchased this house in January ($465,000) and the proposed line would run through my backyard less than 100 feet from my house. This would severely devalue the new property I just purchased, not to mention the eyesore in my backyard and right next to my new house.

Taxpayers have made an investment in these lands for agricultural / food production.  Where possible use lands not in the Ag Conservation Easement purchase program, or a land Trust Program.  The PA taxpayers have a made financial commitment to these lands and as supported by public policy thee lands should remain exclusively for ag production.

As the PA substation site has not been selected you still have a opportunity to select non preserved lands. This is a request to seek your willingness to work with the PA Ag Community many of whom are Farm Bureau Members.  \nA second request is to attempt to avoid enrolled ASA lands to minimize impacts to those farm operations.  Many dairy farms in the Lower Chanceford region have made recent capital improvements to their family farms and anticipate financial rewards however stray voltage issues would serve to undermine their farm improvements.  Efforts to install this new electric infrastructure will harm valuable farming soil structure and losses will continue for years due to soil compaction and subsoil remaining on the upper levels.\nIntroducing towers to large contiguous acres of cropland will introduce wildlife habitat at each pole with resulting crop damage and holes creating farm tractor hazards.  Farmers are all to familiar with the lack of maintenance associated with towers and ROW lines and the burden then falls to the farmer to deal with. \nEfforts to work with each farmer is critical as the energy industry seeks to export PA's energy.

Crossing commercial land is more expensive.\nCrossing Maple Lawn Farms interrupts not only agriculture, but events attended by the general public.

The construction of power lines through preserved property is counter to that agreement and inconsistent with the intention of the agricultural preservation and farm and natural land trusts.<br>6/19/2017","<b>Robert V & Joanne Creter<\/b><br>176 Mt Ash Lane Shippensburg, PA 17257<br>bobandjocreter@pa.net<br><br>Would like a written response:\nWe attended your public meeting on June 13, 2017 in Chambersburg as potentially effected property owners in your study area for a new electric substation and connecting power lines to connect a new 30 acre rice substation. This is to provide access to an existing 500kv power line in our area and eventually connect to an exisiting substation south to an existing substation near ringold MD. We were given fairly clear answers posed by us and some our neighbors who attended the meeting. As we walked through the information stations the size and configuration of the new towers and their right-of-way were explained. obviously this will be an intrusive eyesore in an area that is primarily agriculture and woodland. In addition there are many beautiful and well maintained residences in the area. After much questioning with Steve Tinsley itis apparent except for the substation 30 acre plots, which will be outright purchases from the exisiting property owners, the balance of the huge acreage needed for the line will be an easement arrangement for the 130 foot right of way with the affected landowners. It is my understanding if agreements can not be reached the right of way could be obtained by eminent domain. based on the two alternatives for the rice road substation and connecting lines the substation should be located on the east side of RT81 on the sands property and not on the west side of 81 affecting our properties. The karst geology in this area and fragile nature of ground water can not be ignored. Your people indicated to develop the new substation on the bob martin traction the west side of rt 81 blasting would probably be done to level the site for the new substation. We also observed and noted to your staff that after viewing the detailed aerial photos there were great inaccuracies with regard to street names and property owners in the immediate area of the proposed line 381. You completely missed carol hozman and therefore be aware and comment because she is located right on your proposed line 381. There seemed to be a lack of knowledge by your staff that all the homes in this area are not served by public water. All of the residences and farms have wells for their water supply which is easily disrupted by heavy construction. There have been occasions when rather distant well drilling has caused problems with existing wells. This whole area on the west side of rt81 depends on the fragile limestone aquifers. As the conversations with your staff continued Laurie was very carefully making notes of these concerns. A very serious impact on the farms and residences and farming activities in this area (west of rt81) in the vicinity of this substation and associated lines must be addressed. The farming in this area is done as small family farms for crop, dairy and fruit production. There is no \"spare\" land for non agricultural, commercial, or industrial use- in short every acre counts. In our personal situation hay is made each year to supplement feed on 2 adjoining dairy farms. At our property this is vital. Additionally I have operated a choose and cut christmas tree operation for several years in the very fields you are proposing for the 381 line alignment. Another adjoining neighbor (barry & linda singly) operate a sheep, goat and fiber business that would be seriously impacted or destroyed. It should also be noted that there are several farm houses and bulling 5 located in this area west of 81 that are civil war and earlier and should not be disturbed. Please consider these comments in making your decisions on this project and keep us posted in any changes of route or time lines.<br>6/19/2017","<b>Robert H & Karen K Gochenaur<\/b><br>3449 Delta Road Airville, PA 17302<br>turkeys5@verizon.net<br><br>our family own and operates 2 farms that are both preserved in lower chanceford township.

Also your rep said that the customers will pay the expense so how could that possibly reduce expenses? It seems rather deceiving to not have detailed maps online for affected landowners.

These classified streams are defined as those that support a population of wild trout of sufficient size and abundance to support a long term and rewarding sport fishery. To help explain the protections that these streams have in place I would like to quote the executive director of the PFBC, John Arway, Froman article in the March/April issue of the Penna Angler, the official publication of the PFBC. \"if the PFBC designates a stream as Class A and the DEP accepts that Commission data, then the Penna DEP is required by regulation to protect the water quality of that stream as a high quality coldwater fishery. This means that anyone who applies for a permit to degrade the stream must comply with the regulatory standards to insure that the wild trout are protected. In addition, the wetlands in or along the flood plains of all of our wild trout streams are protected as Exceptional Value (EV) wetlands. EV wetlands can't be disturbed because of their value in storing and gradually releasing water in order to maintain base flows to protect the survival and maintain wild trout populations through periods of flood and drought.\" So as a Guilford Township citizen and a member (President) of the falling spring chapter of Trout Unlimited we are very concerned about the transmission lines and towers that wold surely effect the riparian buffer zones and wetland areas along the world famous wild trout fishery called the falling spring.<br>6/14/2017","<b>Douglas E & Julia C Martin<\/b><br>3926 Guilford Springs Road Chambersburg, PA 17202<br>pvjerseys@yahoo.com<br><br>Re: 374 suggest running it through wasteland by Tapeworm Road instead of prime farm land.

Besides my family , this farm is the most important thing in my life.  That is why in 1990 the decision was made to place the farm in the Land Preservation Program.  My family and I wish to keep this land open and free to be farmed by my children, grandchildren, and future McElwain generations.  We love this land and wish to preserve it.  Marrying it with towers will only take away from it.\nThe land that will be used to construct the towers is land that should be used to produce food .  Once that land is taken away, it can never be returned to its original state.  It may be a small parcel of land to you, but for us, it could be several hundred bushels of corn, soy beans or wheat.  That is how we earn our living.\nAdditionally several times over the past several years, this farm has been asked to give up land for the betterment of the community.  Carea Road and Rt 136 were constructed cutting precious land from our farm.  I believe we have given enough.\nThank you for your consideration.\nSincerely,\nAllen S.

The construction of these proposed lines cross property that has been preserved and protected by the Agricultural Preservation and farm and Natural Land Trusts. There is an agreement in place with York County and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania that places consistent restrictions on the property to insure the property remains solely agricultural and in no way used for commercial development. Construction of you proposed power lines on the property or running through the property is a direct violation of this significant and necessary agreement to protect not only the land but the wildlife.\nAs a homeowner and land owner, I also fully oppose to the construction of these power lines. We the homeowners, purchased homes and/or land specifically in this area due to the natural environment. Constructing visible and audible power lines through this area would destroy not only the established ecosystem, but what the homeowners/land owners have worked hard for. Studies show that properties in close proximity to power lines lost an average of 6.3 % in property value. Not a significant loss to a huge company, but it would be a complete loss to the people who have worked hard to live in an area of their choice and to provide a \"country atmosphere\" for their children to grow up in.\nMy children are yet another reason i fiercely oppose the construction of the power lines. There are studies that state high voltage power lines cause cancer and there are also studies that object and state they do not. BUT...there is not one single study that states there is a 100 % guarantee that high voltage power lines do not cause cancer or pose any other health risk. A risk I am not willing to take. I have 3 healthy children and I in no way want a possible health risk in proximity to our home, especially when it is completely unnecessary. If you choose to ignore all of the homeowner's pleas and construct the power lines, your company will be the first to blame if any of my children develop a health issue..... any health issue.\nSincerely, \nRhonda Jones<br>6/23/2017","<b>Karen Benedict<\/b><br>5419 Manheim Road Waynesboro, PA 19268<br>karrib@gmail.com<br><br>One of the proposed paths for your project crosses over the corner of our property.  We live on the remaining 8 acres of my family's dairy farm, which has been in our family since the mid-1800s.  It is a secluded property surrounded by orchards and farm fields.  My husband and I don't have much in the way of material wealth, but have worked hard to have and keep this home.  My husband works 50 hours a week.  Frankly, we don't want this power line crossing our property, even on the corner, or adjacent to our property.  Our hope is to stay here when we retire (my father was born, lived most of his life, and died in this house at the age of 92).  But the possibility does exist that one or both of us may not be able to do that.  In that eventuality, the only thing we have of value to help us in our old age is this property.  In addition to our own personal objection to living in very close proximity to 135-foot-high steel towers carrying multiple buzzing high tension power lines, we have a justifiable fear that the installation of a high-tension power line over or directly adjacent to our property will have a negative impact on its value.  The property is too small to generate any income with agriculture, and our location and seclusion are substantial factors in its value.\nIt makes more sense to locate these towering steel structures along a corridor which already has this type of or similar installation or public utilities, or in a remote location, rather than in the middle of pastoral farm land interspersed with moderately dense populations.  the construction of the proposed line along the route adjacent to adjacent to me and most likely many of the other routes nearby, would ultimately degrade the quality of life in our Franklin County farm country.\nFrankly, I am not happy with the proposed construction of a power line that has the effect of decreasing the quality of my life, and that of my fellow Franklin county residents in order that someone else may pay a little less for their electricity.  Especially when Franklin county has a median income that is much less (from 50% to 75% less) than that many of our neighbors to the south.\nWe feel you should also know that both our property and the piece to the north of us (now owned by John Rudolph) are the low point of a large watershed through which your proposed line directly runs.

Doyle<\/b><br>158 Norris Road Delta, PA 17314<br>doylefarm@gmail.com<br><br>Letter of proposed site S5\nTo whom it concerns,\nI have lived on my property, Doyle Farm, since 1979.  At that time the area beyond my fence was a corn field.  The farm floods every spring from the run-off of my neighbor's fields and after hard summer rains. So the first project was to keep water on and in the land.  Since that time, I have planted on the farm every year towards an environmentally sound landscape.  This especially includes the piece of my property your proposed plan will clear cut.\nHawthorns, Shrubby Dogwoods, Pines and Catalpas are planted on that site.  The birds brought in the rest.  It is a habitat for quite a few bird species.  I only know a handful, but when I first lived here, there were no birds.  If you need an actual count, I can get the Audubon Societies of York and Lancaster Chapters to come and count the bird species for you.  They said they would be glad to help.  Not only has the bird population increased in the 37 years I have lived here but there are at least a few species of owls I hear.\nThat area also provides shelter for deer.  I often see them in there and I notice that the female does with fawns know they are safe.  The farm has foxes, rabbits, raccoons, pheasants, and wild turkeys that also find shelter and protection in those thickets.  Voles and moles attract eagles that nest in the woods NE of my property and I see plenty of hawks.\nDoyle Farm is a \"Green Space\" as noticed on your map and an oasis in a desert of monocultures and chemical sprays.  Once I spent summers not seeing a butterfly.  Now the farm is a stopping station for the Monarch, whose habitat is endangered, and pollinators such as humming birds, ask the Butterfly Societies of York and Lancaster to count them for you.\nMy property is also habitat for bees, not honey bees, but native bees.  They nest in the ground and rotting tree limbs.  There are so many varieties I have no need to worry about pollinating any of my vegetable plants.  Whereas my Amish neighbor says she must.  Native bees are being lost to pesticides and herbicides sprays.  And I am well aware of when my farmer neighbors spray, as they are aware of me.  I can get a Xerces Society to come and count bees. I would have to get people from the government or a conservancy.\nThese are the reasons why I do not want your proposed power line to run through my property.\nAs for the site you draw your line thru, there is seepage, so much that in the thaw of spring, I have lost a boot from my foot because of the wet.  I had my land dowsed once by a local man because I thought to put a pond near the road. He assured me these underground springs could fill it. That is reason I planted the area with trees because I couldn't farm it.  It also allows a decrease in my land taxes. \nAlso note: The land across Norris Road (Tayacres) has springs in his lower field next to the ditch.  I've seen them abandon their tractors because they couldn't drive them out.  That water source is on the USDA geology survey map.\nAs for my house, it is 1860's tenant farm house with outbuildings.  We have geese, chickens, guineas, peacock, dogs and cats.  We sell eggs and I plant an organic vegetable garden and sell the produce.\nPrior to my retirement business, Doyle Farm Nursery sold perennials and native plants.  It was quite successful and I know many people who would come and support my request to save my land and the wildlife habitat it has created.\nAs well as being a horticulturalist, I am a published writer, speaker, enthusiastic native plant professional.  I did write for a local newspaper as a local reporter and columnist.  I still submit articles from time to time.\nYour meeting caught me by chance as I was attending a native plant conference at the same time. I came home early Thursday to receive a phone call from my neighbor who told me of your proposed plan to cut thru our properties.  This took me by surprise.\nAccording to the map I received in the mail, your project area shows EAST of Route 74.  We live WEST. I hadn't planned to attend.  However, as I look very closely with a magnifying glass, I see it says \"existing\".  It is very misleading of your company.

Of your proposed power lines, I am against these due to the  health risks posed to my family.  I am also against them because my property value will go down without compensation.  There is also a great view to the north of our home. Your power lines will inhibit a great view.  We already have to deal with a landfill near our hoe.  Now you want to possibly put these lines on the other side of our home.  The farm land that you want to use has been protected from development. It has been protected because it is great farmland all around even with the great views.

I am writing to you to day in regards to the proposed high voltage power lines in Franklin County.  One of the proposed routes of the power lines places them along White Church Road in Chambersburg.  Transource identifies the routes a s324, 301, and 302.\nThe proposed route is going thru land that has been preserved under the Farmland Preservation Program.  As you may know tax dollars from the state, county, and township have been used to preserve this precious commodity.  I find it appalling that your company is even considering developing this preserved land.\nI live at 4677 White Church Road, Chambersburg, PA (Your ID 3524) with my wife and two young boys.  Both my wife and I are concerned about the long term health effects on our family.  There are several legitimate scientific studies that identify several dangers of living near high voltage power lines.\nMy wife and I are also concerned about the value of our property going down.  Studies that I have seen show that property values will go down by 5% to 8%.  I have asked your representatives about this and they have told us that we will not be compensated for our loss.  We were told will not be compensated because the power lines are about 600 to 1200 yards to the north of our home. \nWe we purchased our home in 2015 we knew that we would have to contend with the nearby landfill.  Now there is a possibility of having these high voltage power lines.  If these power lines are installed we will not have one nice view of the area that we live in.   The sight of these power lines will inhibit everyone's view of Michaux state forest.\nThere is also an airstrip in the area between Orchard Road and Interstate 81.  There is a very real possibility that your proposed route could interfere with aircraft.\nI could have easily sent you an e-mail with my concerns.  However, a letter is a tangible item.  Our home and health is tangible to my family.  Just as you hold this very real letter, these power lines are a very real possibility.  I would ask that you deeply consider another route for your power lines that do not transverse the White Church Road area.

The property has been in my family since before the 1850's. Our water source is a natural spring that has been in use for countless years, and the property is most likely the site of Native American hunting camps, judging from the large quantity of flint artifacts that are to be found here. The artifacts include spear tips, scraping tools, drilling tools, and large quantities of cast offs from the flint napping process. The power line also passes directly over a stone quarry that dates from the late 1700's. \nI object to the construction of this power line in Franklin County for a number of reasons, one being the negative impact that it will have on the property values of all along the route. The other is the impact on the quality of life of those along the route. The em radiation from these high tension lines does have an impact on plant and animal life along their route.

We were the developers of the housing development we live in. We had to purchase a farm to acquire the site for our dream home. We worked for ten years in design, permitting and infrastructure installation before we could build our home. We paid the power company to put the existing above ground electrical lines underground. The entire housing development we built has underground utilities.\nOur home is twenty five feet above the Falling Spring Stream and has a view of about eight hundred feet of the Falling Spring Stream. Six rooms of our home are built with views of this beautiful scene. There is about thirty feet of glass windows overlooking this priceless view. There is no amount of money you could pay us to destroy this view. Most homes are not built with the sole reason of their location being a specific view. Our whole housing development was built because it was the only way we could get this specific site.\nThe Falling Spring Stream is a very high quality natural cold water limestone spring stream and the trout are native trout. This stream is not stocked like many trout streams in Pennsylvania. This area of the Falling Spring Stream is fly fishing catch and release only. The native trout are very wild and dart frantically about when they see you or your shadow.  They are not like stocked nursery trout that have this wild trait bred out of the gene pool.  Working around, along, and over this stream will be very disruptive to the native trout in this stretch of the Falling Spring Stream. The vibration of blasting or hammering the limestone rock near the stream will send vibrations through the ground into the stream spooking the wild trout.\nCutting existing trees and preventing new trees being planted along this stretch of the stream will degrade the stream by allowing sunlight to warm the stream water and surrounding land so that surface water entering the stream will be warmer.\nProposed segment 367 appears to cross over the Falling Spring Stream twice and parallels or overhangs the falling Spring Stream for a distance of about five hundred feet. This is a very poor choice for a proposed route since it will impact the Falling Spring Stream and native trout population more than any other of the proposed routes. It would be best if a route were chosen that will not even cross the Falling Spring Stream. Failing that a route that crosses the falling Spring Stream once at a ninety degree angle would have the less impact than segment 367.\nI am in the process of interviewing law firms that I feel will best defend against segment 367 and will oppose segment 367 legally to the highest court that I can and politically with all the resources I can get. I will never willingly allow this line to cross my property. \nPlease remove segment 367 from your choice of routes.\nJohn Helman<br>6/27/2017","<b>Kimberly Carrick<\/b><br>441 Ridge Road Fawn Grove, PA 17321<br>kimcarrick01@gmail.com<br><br>There is an underground transatlantic cable running through my property, across the street and next door to me.<br>6/27/2017"],null,null,null,null]}],"limits":{"lat":[38.4083194,40.2909667],"lng":[-82.7894304,-75.2987202]}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
