WDVM’s Jonathan Hunter was there and has our story. Jonathan Hunter: the Quincy Community Center was packed as many in Franklin County came out to learn more about Transource’s project to build a transmission line. Some Franklin County residents organized the meeting for the community. “We felt that the information presented by Transource was kind of one-sided, that they weren't telling people the whole picture.” Transource wants to build a transmission line that will go from Smithsburg, Maryland to north of Chambersburg. The company's goal is to relieve congestion in the power grid, and to provide people with cheaper electricity. However, some believe the project brings more harm than good. “I live on a piece of land that's been in my family since the 1850's and the idea of this power line, honestly, when I first heard about it, it made me sick to my stomach to think that this may go by my house. It's a power company that wants to make a lot of money, they want to sell a lot of energy to the cities and they want to run these towers and these lines through Franklin County. We don't benefit from it, it'll destroy our property values, it's environmentally dangerous.” During the meeting both a lawyer and a farmland preservationist spoke and outlined to the crowd about what Transource needs for approval and also the legal rights Franklin County residents have to try and petition the project. “What I really learned is that the property owners here are not alone, we have resources within the state, within the community, different organizations that are there to help us.” Reporting in Franklin County, Jonathan Hunter, WDVM news.
