thank you for sending me a copy of the v2 route map.</mark> <mark class = "neg"> the maps presented on your website and in your mailings were not detailed and many residents of the norrisville/jarrettsville area were unaware that your proposed line routes would cross their properties.</mark> <mark class = "pos"> your mailings were not made in enough time and were also not detailed enough for residents to make informed comments at the june 7 meeting.</mark>

to whom it concerns ,
i have lived on my property , doyle farm , since 1979.</mark>  at that time the area beyond my fence was a corn field. <mark class = "neg"> the farm floods every spring from the run-off of my neighbor's fields and after hard summer rains.</mark> so the first project was to keep water on and in the land.  since that time , i have planted on the farm every year towards an environmentally sound landscape. <mark class = "pos"> this especially includes the piece of my property your proposed plan will clear cut.</mark> hawthorns , shrubby dogwoods , pines and catalpas are planted on that site.  the birds brought in the rest. <mark class = "pos"> it is a habitat for quite a few bird species.</mark>  i only know a handful , but when i first lived here , there were no birds. <mark class = "pos"> if you need an actual count , i can get the audubon societies of york and lancaster chapters to come and count the bird species for you.</mark> <mark class = "pos"> they said they would be glad to help.</mark> <mark class = "pos"> not only has the bird population increased in the 37 years i have lived here but there are at least a few species of owls i hear.</mark> <mark class = "pos">that area also provides shelter for deer.</mark> <mark class = "pos"> i often see them in there and i notice that the female does with fawns know they are safe.</mark> <mark class = "pos"> the farm has foxes , rabbits , raccoons , pheasants , and wild turkeys that also find shelter and protection in those thickets.</mark> <mark class = "pos"> voles and moles attract eagles that nest in the woods ne of my property and i see plenty of hawks.</mark> doyle farm is a "green space" as noticed on your map and an oasis in a desert of monocultures and chemical sprays. <mark class = "pos"> once i spent summers not seeing a butterfly.</mark> <mark class = "neg"> now the farm is a stopping station for the monarch , whose habitat is endangered , and pollinators such as humming birds , ask the butterfly societies of york and lancaster to count them for you.</mark> my property is also habitat for bees , not honey bees , but native bees. <mark class = "neg"> they nest in the ground and rotting tree limbs.</mark> <mark class = "pos"> there are so many varieties i have no need to worry about pollinating any of my vegetable plants.</mark> <mark class = "pos"> whereas my amish neighbor says she must.</mark> <mark class = "neg"> native bees are being lost to pesticides and herbicides sprays.</mark> <mark class = "pos"> and i am well aware of when my farmer neighbors spray , as they are aware of me.</mark>  i can get a xerces society to come and count bees. <mark class = "neg">i would have to get people from the government or a conservancy.</mark> these are the reasons why i do not want your proposed power line to run through my property. <mark class = "neg">as for the site you draw your line thru , there is seepage , so much that in the thaw of spring , i have lost a boot from my foot because of the wet.</mark>  i had my land dowsed once by a local man because i thought to put a pond near the road. <mark class = "pos">he assured me these underground springs could fill it.</mark> <mark class = "pos">that is reason i planted the area with trees because i couldn't farm it.</mark> <mark class = "neg"> it also allows a decrease in my land taxes.</mark> 
also note : the land across norris road (tayacres) has springs in his lower field next to the ditch. <mark class = "neg"> i've seen them abandon their tractors because they couldn't drive them out.</mark>  that water source is on the usda geology survey map. as for my house , it is 1860's tenant farm house with outbuildings.  we have geese , chickens , guineas , peacock , dogs and cats. <mark class = "pos"> we sell eggs and i plant an organic vegetable garden and sell the produce.</mark> <mark class = "pos">prior to my retirement business , doyle farm nursery sold perennials and native plants.</mark> <mark class = "pos"> it was quite successful and i know many people who would come and support my request to save my land and the wildlife habitat it has created.</mark> <mark class = "pos">as well as being a horticulturalist , i am a published writer , speaker , enthusiastic native plant professional.</mark>  i did write for a local newspaper as a local reporter and columnist.  i still submit articles from time to time. <mark class = "pos">your meeting caught me by chance as i was attending a native plant conference at the same time.</mark> <mark class = "pos">i came home early thursday to receive a phone call from my neighbor who told me of your proposed plan to cut thru our properties.</mark> <mark class = "pos"> this took me by surprise.</mark> <mark class = "pos">according to the map i received in the mail , your project area shows east of route 74.</mark>  we live west i hadn't planned to attend.  however , as i look very closely with a magnifying glass , i see it says "existing". <mark class = "neg"> it is very misleading of your company.</mark>  i am sure more neighbors would have been at your meeting if it showed the reality. <mark class = "neg"> it is a shock.</mark></p>

we we purchased our home in 2015 we knew that we would have to contend with the nearby landfill.</mark>  now there is a possibility of having these high voltage power lines. <mark class = "neg"> if these power lines are installed we will not have one nice view of the area that we live in.</mark> <mark class = "neg">  the sight of these power lines will inhibit everyone's view of michaux state forest.</mark> there is also an airstrip in the area between orchard road and interstate 81. <mark class = "neg"> there is a very real possibility that your proposed route could interfere with aircraft.</mark> <mark class = "neg">i could have easily sent you an e-mail with my concerns.</mark>  however , a letter is a tangible item.  our home and health is tangible to my family.  just as you hold this very real letter , these power lines are a very real possibility. <mark class = "neg"> i would ask that you deeply consider another route for your power lines that do not transverse the white church road area.</mark>  if you have further questions for me , i can be reached at 717-262-8522 or email at newman0607@gmail.com. <mark class = "pos">sincerely ,
