She also likes that peers form opinions and ideas about one another based on their ideas and work ethic, as opposed to fashion, make-up, other friends, etc.  I like that the majority of her classes are filled with kids who take learning seriously. She is gifted classes.  We have also been blown away by the incredible field trip opportunities she has had for his year - several of which some, or all, of my other three children were able to experi, as well.

FARM subsidies paying for field trips. Extracurriculars like Entrepreneurship and languages.","The flexiablity. Communication","The flexible schedule is something we appreciate often as it makes scheduling doctor's appointments, therapy sessions, etc. much easier. The ability to spend more time on lessons where our student is struggling has helped him catch up academically, filling in \"blanks\" left by weak programs at his old brick-and-mortar school. Because he's a \"504 kid,\" we can use the recorded lessons, note outlines provided by instructors, and (as needed) a hands-on approach to provide the accommodations his old school was always reluctant to offer. And especially this year, he's had more creative options for completing portfolios, which has let him shine.","The ability to keep track of what my child is learning in each subject.","I like the support and the flexibility and the trips available","Flexibility to complete assignments as well as the supplies and materials provided.","I LOVE the flexibility CCA offers, both with scheduling and with allowing kids to move at their own pace. I have a 3rd grader reading at a 6th grade reading level working on 4th grade math. Brick and mortar would NEVER be willing or able to manage that scenario...having 15 years of teaching experience under my belt I'm certain of that.

I love that I can see her daily progress so that I can hold her accountable, as well as,  be aware of what she needs help with. If she were in a brick and mortar school, she would fall under the radar because she is \"not as bad as other kids\", a.k.a. not autistic. My daughter is more than a number, statistic, or a dollar sign. She deserves to be given the tools to succeed.","We can build our own schedule.","Flexibility","The flexibility in getting assignment done","I like that my child gets to work at her own pace.

There are several items that I could talk about til the cows come home.  One thing I really appreciate is the use of the webcams for the elementary students this year.  When my son was in the elementary school, there was no use of the webcams even though the school had the technology.  So this has been absolutely great and I am appreciative.  The teachers, well, there is not enough space to tell my positive feelings about the teachers this year.  I would like to specifically mention Mrs. Keet, my daughter's first grade teacher.  She is absolutely fabulous.  She is welcoming of all the students, she is warm and makes all the children feel cared for.  She has a wonderful way of being consistent and innovative with lessons and specials offered in live lesson.  She engages all her students incredibly well and manages the classroom with expertise and love.  I do like ow the field trips compliment the in class learning but I am especially pleased with the STEM program.  I am glad that CCA has found a way to offer STEM activities to the elementary school as there are other schools who only offer STEM to high school, middle school only if in a good district.  So I am impressed with this program.  Keep it coming.  Again, the staff are excellent and easy to talk to even when the topic is not so easy.  They are very respectful and I always feel heard.","The support for my child, flexibility, the commitment that the teachers seems to have and the overall course work. My daughter had an IEP upon entering high school. I admitted her to another cyber charter in which I was very dissatisfied with although the IEP was dropped. I admitted her to CCA with made a great difference and gave her more confidence. \nThank you CCA.\n\n\n","It's personal. It's convenient. My child is safe. Everyone is hands on.

I also like how children have the opportunity to do an \"Assessment approvement\" when their grades fall below a certain level.","Students learn at their own pace, Administration is very helpful and ready to communicate.","Constant, engaged, and flexible support from the teachers and staff. The teachers and staff really care about my child and me - not only grades, but about our family, about my child, her interests, her well-being. CCA as a whole has a nurturing environment, the school itself seems devoted to the student's well-being and learning. The teachers work together as a team, there is great communication, CCA really does consider the parent/caretaker as part of the team (not the enemy). Any questions or concerns I have are addressed immediately. There is open communication, frequent meetings, and I don't have to fight for answers.

Dr. Flurie is always updating families and he really cares about us, you can tell. The teachers are also very good at what they do. This year we noticed that the teachers are even better with their own availability to students, happy last year, but even better this year. CCA seems very serious about being a stellar competitive school and it shows. I only wish I would have made the decision to have my child attend CCA long ago, but she will graduate (proudly) from CCA this year and we're happy with that. Thank you to Dr. Flurie, Amy Boyd, the teachers, Counserlors, Mr. Comegna was wonderful and very helpful. We will show you how much we appreciate CCA by giving well deserved great reviews and informing parents about CCA and all they stand for. THANKS MUCH.","My child can work at her own pace.

She loves the fact that if she have questions the teachers are always there to help. I feel that she is overwhelmed with the portfolios. They should be at the end of each semester. Doing live lessons, lesson planner assignments, and portfolios is a bit much for a child to take in and complete within a week. I feel that it's not allowing her time to actually study for something she doesn't understand due to meeting deadlines. Otherwise, the school is awesome and I'm proud to be a CCA parent.","The Curriculum, the pace and staff","my daughter can pace her self nd I hear from the teachers regulary","We can work from home.","Being involved with my child education and helping her through every step of her growth.

CCA is perfect for our children who are at-risk in a crime ridden city with many issues!  CCA also in my opinion out ranks all of the brick and Morter schools available in the Philadelphia area.  The majority of the school system in Philadelphia is in disarray across the board and turning out academically handicapped students year after year unfortunately. CCA continues to exceed expectations. \n","That he can work at his own pace and the modified quizzes and tests","online and flexibility","I like the communication between teachers and students .

I am a bit disappointed with the amount of time and energy that is required to do well in the course.  There are an excessive amount of portfolios for the students.  My daughter in 9th grade has to spend most of her time doing school work.  It is just too much work.  There should be opportunities for the students to interact with one another at the local office for spelling bees or games or movies.  They should be able to meet other live students and not just online.","The fact that the work is online and we can contact the teachers via webmail or on the phone.","Convenience and the amount and the quality of the materials.

I have my own child and work with my niece and nephew. there is a five year difference between them. Having their lessons do what I call \"synch up\" is extremely helpful. It also lets the younger one feel like a big kid because I can often allow her to work with the older ones in a way that remains familiar to her. It also allows the older ones to flex their knowledge muscles by \"teaching\" her things she hasn't gotten to yet. There are many other things I have come to love about CCA and they are why we are in our 11th year with them. As my daughter's final year approaches, I am remorseful because not only have I been able to expand her knowledge, my knowledge has increased as well.","The flexibility for the students and the exceptional customer service provided by the staff.","CCA have good communication skills, they keep  a relationship with families ,it's a great program!","I love how my daughter has a flexible schedule and she is in a safe environment just in case something goes down.","My child can move at her own pace without distractions.I also like the amount of time spent in her sessions.","Reading Eggs and Brain Pop","The teachers and being able to work with the children","The staff members are courteous and polite.","The teacher  is very helpful","My child has enjoy learning more overall and that's all I ever really wanted","The teachers and family mentor","Being able to move at a certain pace.","The staff is professional and caring.","The flexibility.

Also that they have school books to learn from. CCA school curriculum is awesome.","I used to like the scheduling of the Live Lessons, but not anymore.  They conflict.","The major benefit of CCA over our public school options is that assignments are not missed.

Is it the ability to be with my children all day and watch them blossom? Yes! CCA has become such an important part of our every day life and has made our family even more blessed!","The best part of CCA for our family is a fantastic mix of teachers, courses, curriculum, open communication and flexibility. The teachers at CCA have been top notch, the courses and having live lessons *every day* in middle school has been incredible for my 7th grader. The curriculum is challenging. The communication from the middle school team to the parents is top notch and the ability to have some flexibility with all of that makes it a perfect concoction of academia.","The flexibility and availability of the teachers.

I appreciated the ability to go on ahead in our work where we wanted to, as well as a chance to take it a little slower when needed. I also really liked the live lesson times - the sense of belonging to a class with a teacher actually talking to you on the computer was a good thing.

If it is a concept he needs a little more time on, we can take an extra day or two until he learns the concept.

We also like our daughter having the ability to take her time with courses that are challenging instead of being rushed through due to time constraints of a traditional school day, resulting in less stress. Most importantly to us, the bullying and torment that occurred daily when our daughter attended a local private school for years 1 through 4 is non- existent and a non-issue attending CCA, for that we can't express how happy we are.","The freedom of time, the curriculum is wonderful, and the teachers are very knowledgeable, friendly,  and helpful.","Be able to manage and set her school lessons to fit our schedule during the day.

I think he likes being able to work ahead (this does correlate with the capability of flexibility in most, but not all of his courses).  At this point, he is 91% through the semester and 92% through the year on his course progression meter.  He has finished quite a few courses for the year, including, but not limited to his Chinese class, his Biology, class, his Health class, and nearly finished with his Geography class.  He is on the route to graduating a year prematurely.  He is taking summer classes to accommodate that goal as well.

Always announcements for things in a great amount of time.all in all a great school","I know what the kids are supposed to be doing in school and I can help to make sure their schooling is done .It is an experience that we can work together on. I feel they are more successful.They get more help from the teachers.","Awesome Learning support. And very helpful teachers that make sure several times how things are going.","The flexibility and individual attention. The coursework is more challenging then the bricks and mortar school.","it fits into our schedule easier","My child is doing SOOO much better in this environment. He has ADHD and being quietly at home without all the distractions has improved his grades tremendously. And, he's much happier.","All the teachers are very good about answering any questions, and very nice to all my children.","I can work with my children one on one and if they need more help you have awesome teachers there to help. I also find live lessons to be very helpful and I feel like the kids enjoy the interaction with the other children. I feel like I spend more time with my children. If we get behind a little the teachers are awesome about letting us get caught up. \n","that the teachers work with the kids to make sure that they get what they need and they make sure that the coaches understand how to help the kids.","Easy communication with all staff.","Once upon a time, I was a traditional home school mom of 5, choosing my own curriculum and free-spiritedly teaching my children.  The two oldest graduated and the remaining 3 and I decided to evaluate our direction.  Here we are, almost 6 years later, continuing education with CCA. I love the support of the teachers, the organization of the curriculum, the obvious desire of the school to see their students succeed.  We all love the fact that we are not forced to attend a live lesson as it happens.  The option to view a recorded lesson is great and fits into our schedule.  My preference is that they would attend the live lessons as they are scheduled, but the recorded option is one of the reasons we chose CCA more than 5 years ago and have continued to choose CCA as our school.","We LOVE that it is flexible!  Also, my child does best with one on one learning and we are able to do that with CCA.  There are no kids being distracting and there are no bullies.  There are also no snow days to worry about making up.","We like that it is flexible and the student can learn at his/her own pace.","i like the ease and ability to do work at anytime of the day.","Flexible schedule.","I especially appreciate the flexibility CCA has to offer. The school's set scheduling motivates my child, but still gives her the flexibility to alter her plans to fit my family's busy lives. CCA also provides supportive teachers and has the benefit of being free.","Flexibility of school hours/days off","We like the flexibility CCA gives to us in our school day.  The teachers are dedicated.  Teachers are easy to get a hold of when needed, and if not, they always call back.","Having the children home and away from outside influences.  Flexibility of schedule.","flexibility","I like the ease of the school day.  I also appreciate that my children are able to talk to their teachers when they are struggling.  I like the access to recorded lessons.   My children enjoy working at their own pace.","more structured than our last online Cyber","flexibility","We have been mostly lucky enough to have teachers who are flexible in their approach to teaching, The best teachers have been the ones who say to us- What is important is that your child is learning.","I would say we like three things the most.  The teachers really seem to care and engage with the students, and take the time to create interesting assignments.  The curriculum is flexible and gives our son the capability to (mostly) work from his schedule, which means he can take music lessons or tennis lessons during the day.  Finally, the structure of the school has made him much more self-sufficient and self motivated, which is a hugely important skill for high school and college.","The fact that my son can learn at his own speed while still being challenged. I also love that each class is recorded so I can help him when needed","My student is able to communicate with the teacher and his classmates yet still he is able to maintain a flexible schedule is what I love about this school. I also like the fact that my child is being challenged actively and appropriately for him to reach his best potential.","the live lessons, the flexible times to do the quick checks, quizzes, and test, the tutoring times,","Flexibility with live lesson schedule/recordings. The ability to adapt the learning pace to the individual student.","What my son and I like best is that he is not rushed through the learning process. When he attended a traditional school he was left behind and did not receive the help he asked for. The teachers had to move on and there was a lack of help. My son was doing well at a traditional school however, he was getting to stressed and frustrated at such a young age and that was not something a child should go through. Since we started CCA my son has learned so much more and we are able to take our time where he understands the assignments better and go back through the videos.","I like that my child is able to go at her own pace and not be rushed to finish her work.","Flexibility.","There is a reasonable amount of school work with only a minimum of busy work.","no homework","My son being able to learn subjects at his own pace","the flexibility","teachers are flexible and enthusiastic","Perks of field trips and reimbursed community classes\n","The flexibility with her schedule and working more at her own pace.

Wish we had made the switch sooner!!","The ability for my child to work at her own pace.","the staff and how they work with your child","My son is able to do his work at a home environment, or at a small tutoring center nearby.

The teachers do not punish a student for handing in homework late (ie. deducting points or only giving half credit) but grade it appropriately.","The individual attention my child gets from a cyber school vs. a public school. The teachers at CCA also care more about the individual student(s) learning  the material and less about how long it takes them to learn and understand the material.","I like that the teachers actually call the parents regarding students attendance, grades, etc. and take note of a student is falling behind.","the flexibility of the schedule","The freedom, help and flexibility the teachers give my student to complete his homework, at his speed to be able to be able to understand the work, and hand it in for an appropriate grade.","I love having immediate access to all his work and grades.

All three of my enrolled children receive great support and feedback from their teachers!\nTwo of my students were enrolled at another virtual charter school, and the learning portal was not as efficient, nor were the teachers as \"connected\".","The flexibility of the assignments and curriculum that is vital to our schedule.","It is very easy for my child to understand and focus on her work and as an adult all the things we have to do are very easy and not hard to find or hard to do.","I love the flexibility the kids have.

For my 7th grader he is having to make real effort for the first time in his schooling.\nHe is also learning how to have relationships with his teachers. I have also developed a closer bond with my K daughter. \nBecause we are Jehovah's Witnesses, we do not celebrate the various holidays - Christmas, New Years, Thanksgiving, Halloween, Valentine's Day, St Patrick's Day, Easter, Mother's Day, Father's Day, etc.  In the Brick &amp; Mortar schools (UDA) we get these holidays essentially \"shoved down our throat.\"  In CCA we get to focus on learning the basics in K.\nAlso - very important, with CCA my son and daughter does not have a 45 min ride each way and they do not have to get up so early - (5:30 AM for Middle &amp; HS, 6:30 - 6:45 AM K-4).\nReturn Times are: MS &amp; HS -3pm, K-4 4 pm.

All the information a student needs is available and accessible.  The planner lets students see what assignments are due and what is coming up.  The course tree lets students know what is coming so they can plan for study time, research or writing.  All the assignments are clear, the rubrics lay out expectations.  The program selects the best text books, and online resources.  This program makes it possible for every student to succeed.  The live lesson recordings allow students to review as needed.

Plenty of information available.","Flexibility of class time.","flexibility","I think CCA's committment to doing the best for their students and families is the thing I like best.  My experience with brick and mortar school was that they wanted to cut parents out of the equation, but with CCA, the parents are not only kept in the loop but are valued.  The flexibility of the program is also very important.  My son was becoming bored in brick and mortar school and was not given the opportunities to progress at his own pace.  CCA has provided that opportunity for him and it has changed him from being bored in school to being excited to learn again.  I also like the many field trip opportunities that CCA provides.  Learning happens in all sorts of places and the field trips add an extra component to their learning that doesn't happen in traditional schools.","Ease to use, flexibility of schedule","The ability to have first-hand knowledge what and how my children are learning as well as a tiny bit of flexibility with the schedule.","There are so many things I like about CCA.  I like that the teachers are available, caring, and want to see the kids succeed.  I like that my kids are able to ask questions and the teachers take the time to answer them.  I love the Live Lessons and how the teachers make the lessons interesting and easy to understand.  The teachers are willing to change if the students aren't getting the material.  Your staff and the Live Lessons are the greatest strengths CCA has.  We have been \"wowed\" by many of the teachers.  Many of them go above and beyond in their quest to teach our kids.","The best part is I can work one on one with my children.","The flexibility of the schedule and having my children home with me.","I like the flexibility and the ability to watch my child learn and grow.  The teachers and staff at CCA have been great and supportive and are responsive to us,  We love going on field trips.","How flexible it is, we can decide what schedule works best for him.","I like that CCA goes with my childrens pace and that they are able to ask their teacher at any time if they have a question.","I love how connected the teachers are with the students.  We came from a private brick and mortar school where the teachers did not have the time to connect individually with the student and know their strengths and weaknesses.  What a difference with CCA!  My son has so many options to get help and ask questions.  The proof of how much he enjoys his teachers is that every spring he is sad to know that he won't have those teachers any longer, but the following year he has a whole new group of wonderful teachers who are just as committed to seeing him succeed.  The wonderful thing about CCA for my daughter is that she can work at her own pace.  When she was in a private brick and mortar school, she felt frustrated waiting for the other kids to \"get\" a concept that she understood.  She grew bored and frustrated, now when she understands something she can move on to the next subject.  Thank you for giving my children back their love of learning.  When they were in school all day, they were too burned out to want to continue to pursue learning outside the classroom.  Now, my daughter writes stories in her free time, she works on budgets for herself, and loves to read.  My son has developed a strong love of history and knowledge and pursues both through watching educational videos, documentaries, and reading classic literature in his free time.  He now draws and sketches, where his previous art teacher offered no encouragement, CCA saw his potential.  I love that CCA knows when to give freedom to stretch and when to encourage reaching out for help!  You are the best!","the freedom to do courses from home","Everybody we've dealt with has been very helpful and friendly. My daughter seems much more relaxed in this environment.","Flexibility. Less stress for the same classes as public school","I like the freedom with the schedule and classes. I like that I have a huge input on my sons education and the way he is taught. I really enjoy getting to spend more time with him during the day.","I like that CCA has some great teachers.

I also appreciate my students being able to learn in a safe environment.","Low stress environment, flexible due dates.","the teachers kindness an explaining showing helping my child with her work an mrs. sharp 4 th grade going the extra mile. and how the whole school reaches out to you for whats the best interest in ur child . i am so very pleased an its refreshing to have them listen to the parents concerns an i welcome their feed back . its nice to know they put ur child first","Just enrolled last week.  So far, I'm amazed how easy the learning has been made and the depth of what is available for the student.  Also feels much more personal than our brick and mortar school experience.","Flexibility of the program and the ability to tailor it to my student.","We like the flexilibilty, the ability to visit face to face with teachers in the Harrisburg office, and we love the field trips.  The field trips are very beneficial for soialzation and also for education.  It is wonderful for our child to attend trips that relate to what he is studying and it helps him apply what he is studying.","I like the flexibility CCA allows in our schedule.","I love that if she has a doctor's appointment, the classes are recorded so she is not missing a lesson.

My children understand better with less goofing off in the class room. They can have their music and still understand what is happening in their lessons.","At this point im very dissatisfied with CCA","Were a team from the school to the learning coaches, apart of the learning experience, watching him grow an learn not missing out on it. Don't have to worry about what's being taught to my child, without me knowing, Don't have to worry about bullying, unlicensed teachers acting out  inappropriately to my child, Don't have to worry about bad lunches, sickness(as much), any other bodily problems that come with a school full of kids, And most of all I Love how its based all around him an his education there is no competition no judgment's, embarrassments, he's free to be him, and at his own rate, its very individualized to each child, everything about the CCA School is beautiful an feel proud an privileged to be apart of it, as well as grateful for my child I now he will get a good education threw this process of schooling.

The best thing for our family is individualized education that meets our son's needs.","For my 7th grade it gives her more of a challenge than a traditional school. For my 2nd grader she does better in a 1 on 1 setting. She can concentrate better.","I like that my kids for the most part can work at their own pace. I love how flexible our schedules can be working with CCA.","Individualized education. Administration and teachers that actually listen to a parent's opinion on their child's needs. Awesome teachers that listen and customize each child's education. Teachers that care and bend over backwards to help each child. Great support and good online resources. A curriculum that is well thought out and tied together in the subjects. Great field trips tied to what is being taught. In short, everything about CCA is great!","It fits with our schedule considering I have to look after my father who is 89 years old and watch my grandson who just turned 1 years old.","I love that I can be more involved in my girls education.  I love that they can get the help and support they need if they are having trouble. And I love the face that my children are being challenged in their studies.  This program is amazing.","I lile thst its flexible","I like the flexibility of school hours.

It is also nice that the student is able to see his or her grades as they go along. This has made my child strive to keep her grades up and ask for help.","My son was so overwhelmed in B&amp;M school he became a behavior problem for the school. He was in a constant state of fight or flight mode. He would explode, then shut down. There were inappropriate verbal issues as well as running from an aide. It culminated when I was called in to pick him up...he was lying on the floor of the principal's office, sobbing. All the accommodations and supports put into place just weren't working. In hindsight, I realize now, those supports were in place to make my son fit into their box, with little room for him to feel in control. My son is smart; he was speaking in full sentences before he was 2. Finding CCA gave me back my son. It gives my son enough of the control he needs to be able to advocate for himself. If an assignment is too overwhelming in that moment, he can walk away and come back to it without repercussions. He doesn't feel trapped anymore. There are no behavior issues in our home (except for the occasional teenage angst). I like the flexibility. I love how the teachers are genuinely there to help and seem like they want to hear from my son! My son is learning to think outside the box-the teachers will listen to his sometimes very different viewpoint and instead of being chastised, he is encouraged to find information to back up his story or gently redirected. They are teaching him to think more flexibly. My son is validated at CCA.","We like the flexibility in the schedule and the ability to be more involved with our student's education.","I appreciate the quality of the teachers and learning program.","Flexibility","I like the flexibility, both in being able to choose live lessons or A-sync and in being able to arrange school around our family schedule.","everything","Placement of child according to academic ability, not age.","The flexibility","I like the flexibility. \n","Flexibility\n\nBeing involved in the learning process.\n\nBeing able to give one on one attention to my student.

For us that means keeping a tight schedule but having flexibility within that schedule to spend more or less time on things as needed.  I like that our day doesn't have to be clogged up with things that are not essential.  I also love that my kids can be home but we still get the organization and help of being in a brick and mortar school.

The flexibility in the schedule is a huge asset.   My daughter is a competitive dancer.  Her life revolves around being at the dance studio approximately 25 hours a week plus many full weekends of travel to participate in regional dance conventions and competitions.

To our surprise, first Mrs. Mary Frances Thorn understand and gave him the time but then later penalized him for taking the time. His final test grade was an A but she did not accept work he submitted after \"HER timeline\" and only her timeline which resulted in a C and not a B.  He then changed teacher and earned his A in Algebra 11. His other issue was with Honors Science which penalized him for being late with a portfolio so his final grade was a B(89) and not an A.  She would not give him any extra work work to earn an extra point.  This hurt his over GPA.

I appreciate the interaction between instructors and learning coaches. I like the fact that my daughter has a chance to learn without interruptions due to unruly behavior in the classroom. She does not miss socialization or intermingling with her peers due to the fact that her father and I make sure that she is connected through other outlets. As a matter of fact other parents have approached us with interest in Cyber schooling. I might also add with the onslaught of mass killings in the schools our home is the safest place for our child to be.","All the support they give","The flexibility","i like that i could learn at the sometime and i feel that she is more in to the school then she was when she use to go to school\ni have told all my friend and family about cca and how happy im with  cca","wide range of subjects that available, and that this is great for visual students for taking notes watching LL again, and going at their pace.","The curriculum and the flexibility.","I like how my children still have a schedule and a class with a teacher.

We see the best opportunity to do that is by keeping them home. Additionally, we want our children learn good behaviors and appropriate life skills alongside their book lessons. The staff at a brick and mortar school just don't have the ratio to allow close monitoring of student behavior and interactions. CCA allows us to expose our children to life skills throughout the course of a day, week, and month so that one day they will be armed with the skills to live as good citizens. While traditional homeschooling was working fine for us, we saw an opportunity to gain extra educational support from teachers and staff at CCA to ensure our children are getting the best education for them. We love the individualized learning path and uninhibited speed at which they can complete lessons. This helps to keep them engaged and challenged. We love the opportunity for field trips and on-site experiences, such as the G&amp;T Meet &amp; Greet. We have been impressed with the forward thinking and technology advances to bring the students the best at home learning experience. We love that you ASK for our input, like this survey, and incorporate ideas and feedback from the parents and students.","The individual attention and the extra help!","The family adviser.

For any student to be excited about learning, they need to be excited by what they are being taught. CCA does this, keeps her wanting to learn more. It encourages her to research beyond her lessons. Going above and beyond is encouraged, not frowned upon.  Having Family Mentors that have been in your shoes, guiding you through the rough spots, is so comforting. The teachers REALLY CARE about each and every student! Her classmates are supportive of each other! They are the icing on the cake!

Also, I don't have to worry about bad weather.  We can do school on bad weather days and on vacation days if we need to save an extra day for the end of the year due to Mom and Dad's job.  Overall, I love CCA and can't see my kids going elsewhere.","The live lessons, regular contact with teacher and classmates.","We are just getting started.  So far so good.","Flexibility","Te teachers are always there to help!","Well first this is not my children first year at a cyber charter school.  Last school year they attended Agora cyber charter and I like CCA better because your curricular is more understandable and broken easily to understand.  I like that my 3rd grader has one teacher for all subjects as at Agora he was in 2nd grade with 4 different teachers and changing classes every 40 min and it was no time to finish one subject before going to the next. Cramming work for a second grader or third grader is too much like high school for me.  I like the parent portal its easy to navigate and I like how I (the Parent) can submit some of the child's work through my portal/portfolio. I also like that I can submit the attendance as well.

I have called certain teachers will no response back.

The reimbursement for after school activities.","The flexibility to do the lessons around our schedule.","everything","So far, our experience has only been elementary school and middle school. I have found the teachers and the live lessons that accompany middle school to be absolutely phenomenal and  would hate to see a decline of live lessons in highschool!

She keeps families informed and is always attentively listening.  Mrs. Houk does so much to help the kids feel connected.  Our daughter has learned so much from her, and I have grown as a Learning Coach through seeing Mrs. Houk teach.  Everyone we have come in contact with at CCA has been like this.  It is apparent how much you all care about learning.  Your flexibility is something we love too.  Our daughter was so timid when she started so we took advantage of the live lesson recordings until she got used to school.  It was because of that and her calls with Mrs. Houk that she asked to attend the \"real ones\" and now attends live lessons.  It has totally transformed her.  She is now not timid at all.

The ability for the students to participate is extra important.  I like how my 4th grader had to raise his hand to get called on.  Though this may seem small, it teaches students some necessary qualities that benefit them outside of school.

I like being able to email or call if we experience an issue or need help or guidance. I like teachers that are willing to work with a student and understand that all children do not learn the same. I like that when portfolios (projects) are given, the children are given a variety of choices instead a one size fits all. This wasn't the case for us before coming to CCA. Our old private school taught to the \"middle\", if you didn't conform or fit in, instead of helping you find your way, they found a way to push you out. It was easier for them that way. We finally left and took our A+ student with us to CCA. I like that, in theory, you can take school with you anywhere, on the road to a field trip, a vacation, sitting in a waiting room, on the sidelines waiting to be \"sent in\",  as long as you have internet (hint, hint . . . we need a ipads and a data service plan).

I would have like more details and hints on how to make the whole process and transition easier. After enrollment you are basically on your own. It was not easy at all and the kid's work load is heavier than traditional school. Which is crazy stressful for both kids and learning coach. There needs to be better support available for new parents with people that can answer specific questions and not just pass on the basic functions, that is easy enough if you read through your info. There are things that parents that have been using the systems knows after a couple years that would really help a new family, but they never go over them.

I'm not sure what all Family Mentors are permitted to do, but that might be useful, if they are allowed to meet with families and show them hands-on how to do things and model ways of keeping up with lessons, assignments, etc. Homeschooling can be isolating, so getting together with local CCA families can help with sharing ideas, motivation, and be inspiring.

would like to see CCA partner with a few community collages so seniors could dull enroll thaking the only credit courses they need with CCA and start class so when the graduate CCA they would only need a few more months of school .","You guys are doing great.","CCA is doing fine the way it is.",":)","They are doing a good job\n","I'm not sure","I think the start up process should be better explained at enrollment.  We are three months into this, and we are still having to figure some of the ins and outs of the lessons and how things work.","Give the students and their coaches books that go with the classes like you used to.  This idea of study partnerships and no books is a load of crap.  Students can not learn without the knowledge of a book to accompany material the teacher does not cover in class.  If the student has special needs, and can not write fast enough to enter all of the information, does not have a printer, or has difficulty with their internet services, their learning situation is totally robbed.  Books are needed for all classes!  I can understand the art and the computer design classes, but the history and math classes are manditory.","they do a lot for my child","not sure","I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING YOU CAN RIGHT NOW TO BETTER SERVE US.","N/A","I think you already are doing a great job of serving my family.","get more options to help children in need.  bring back in home tutoring.  Some kids just dont function well in a live lesson format.","i'm happy","I am satisfied with the program at this time.","CCA is doing a great job serving my family and I.","Please do NOT put those temporary zeros in the gradebook for students who are behind - immediately BEFORE the progress report; please let the progress report reflect their grades for work that IS completed.  This action has been incredibly frustrating and disappointing for my student.  \nPlease be more informative to parents that their students can take Algebra early (7th or 8th grade), and that they can take Biology in 9th - that 9th grade science is not required to graduate.  I have been telling everyone I can.  \nPlease make the CEO videos available in print as well - I read faster than I listen, and sometimes I just don't have the time to listen.  \nPlease bring back and expand summer school course options, and re-allow 8th graders to begin to take HS courses over that summer before 9th grade.  Please provide more options in the dual enrollment program.  \nPlease, please, PLEASE provide more and better novel options for each year of English/LA - it has been a battle most years to find a novel that is decent for my kids to read for school - it is almost never what is in the curriculum. You have a strong curriculum, but part of the reading material is sadly lacking, and at times down right disgusting.  Please provide reading that is character building instead of immoral.  Perhaps make a list and stock some good character books in the CCA library that parents can choose from, instead of me starting from scratch searching my library or the internet.\nPlease provide a place where we can turn in suggestions such as these at any time during the year - when we are thinking about them.\nKeep up the good work.  Thank you.","CCa has a Family Mentor Live Lesson.  I have been to it three times and it was more of a bitch session then any information.  Maybe have those monthly in a physical building, might be more beneficial.  Sort of like the start of school class...Great Beginnings? Teachers were there to help the students, and support staff ere there to help the parents with things that they might have needed help with.  I found that setting more beneficial.","Elementary school is very confusing.  I feel that it should be a little more streamlined like the middle school.  The communication with the teachers is not easy and frankly it is confusing.  Schoology is good, but I think it needs to be incorporated into book learning as well.  My son likes it because it is like a game...I am not sure if we are actually doing as we are supposed to be...and the teacher is not available to him.","CCA teachers need to be in better contact with the parents. Teh teachers should be able to call the parents back within 24 hours.","By being able to attend a Vocational Technical School locally while in CCA.","Things are fine the way they are.","Better UI. It's a web based school, so the interface should be user friendly and easy to navigate. I shouldn't have to spend over an hour to find something. And no this is not \"just some mom\" complaining. I have the degrees, certs, and experience, if you would like a consult.","They are fine the way it is.","no way at all u r doing a bang up job","None","none","your doing a fine job","keep doing the best that u r doing","Overall I am extremely pleased with CCA this year. We had a few bumps in the road at the beginning of the year with my sons IEP. His file was misplaced; he was put in gifted courses, then general education for all 4 main courses, and then finally put into the 180 courses for math and reading. \nCCA has met my daughters education needs by allowing her to work at her own pace and advance through 1st and 2nd grade quickly. She is now in 3rd and being challenged by the curriculum and thriving! \nAs great as CCA is a few things were difficult this year, the first being field trips. It was frustrating to find out that I couldnt pay for a 2nd field trip myself and then find out later that the field trip was not full to begin with. If we are willing to pay for a trip on our own and not cost the school anything, why would you turn students away? After all the complaining from other families that they couldnt get into field trips because they were all filled up, my children have not been on 1 field trip that was at its max this year. \nAlso, I find it frustrating my daughters third grade teacher does not send out  an update of what is being covered in class and what needs to be covered on her own or with a learning coach. For example, the 3B, Unit 2, lessons 1-5, the story Sukis Kimono teaches about editorials. The portfolio due on day 4 -instructs the students to write an editorial on why they think it is important to be yourself. My daughter watched the lessons but the teacher never went over any aspects of an editorial, even though the assessments 1-4 ask questions about an editorial. The elementary live lessons often times seem to only go over the stories and grammar, leaving out the extra details that are covered on assessments. It would be nice if they teacher mention these things when sending out a weekly email. Such as, please read or please watch the video in lesson 2, page 3 titled., I will not be covering this in lesson. \nThis issue makes me wonder if the teachers are even looking at the assessments. Another example Math 3B, Unit 2, lesson 1 is a practice review of basically improper fractions. Improper fractions were brought up briefly in the online lesson. I was shocked at the review because the problems did not even compare to the 2 examples given in the lesson. When I asked the teacher about it she had to look at the practice review to see what I was talking about. She was shocked that is what the practice review was on. Why are the teachers not going through the lesson assessments to see what the questions are? They are the teachers; it is their job to know what our students are being graded on. I cant tell you how many times I have had to go back to a teacher and ask, Why was this not addressed in class? Improper fractions are a big deal for 3rd grade. \n\nLike I said, I am overall please with CCA but there are a few things that need improved to make the students lessons time efficient. I wasted 20 minutes today trying to figure out why my daughter couldnt answer assessment questions on editorials only to find that her teacher never covered the topic. \n","1. CCA needs to work on the Special Education Department. The lack of communication is frustrating. The fact that the special education managers aren't aware of program and special services that CCA has to provide is concerning. I do not know if the problem lies in the quality of education and experience of the special education managers or if it is lack of training provided by CCA.\n2. Provide direct instruction 4 days a week for core high school courses for those students who struggle in reading and writing. Simply allowing accommodation for these classes is not enough. Elementary has multi-level programs for support and it seems that CCA forgot that learning struggles do not end when entering high school. I am personally concerned for my student for social studies and science. \n3.  Provide enrichment for students who tested well in iReady via software or weekly live lesson. \n4. The impact the PSSAs have on the students is burdensome. Teachers cancel live lessons altogether while only a few provide recordings on the material. \n5. Live lesson for social studies and science at the 3rd and 4th grade level twice a week. Our students have such potential of doing so much better in the middle school curriculum if they could have the enrichment from teachers and groups discussions based on the elementary curriculum. \n6. Career planning trips to tech schools or shops that do apprenticeships.  Many of our CCA students have learning disabilities and do not desire to go to a two or four year University or community college. Per Mike Row and Mike Row works, of the 5.5 million jobs available, 75% of them do not require a college degree. A major problem in our country is so many students with looming college debt and so few jobs in their area of study. These should not count towards monthly field trips. \n7. Allowing more than 1 paid field trips per a month.","At this time I really can't think of anything else you could help my family with but I will be keeping in touch with all of my support team,","Inform us of any advocates available for children which feel some teachers are not allowing flexibility in portfolios.

These teachers are also making LL mandatory when they aren't usually.","I like the way that I can be involved in my child school work and be able to help when needed but CCA can have the teachers help the students one on one once in a while and there grades be updated frequently because my child grades were the same all year and when we would call concerning this they said that they would call tech support but nothing was not done it made my son very upset and also made him feel why should I try when you don't make the effort to help him. Also he had problems concerning the percentages did not go up either due to he would score high on tests and lessons but they would not up the percentages to put up his grades so he felt why should I try. I don't like my son feeling this way and I like CCA but I think this should be looked into because it really concerned me and my son took responsibility and kept calling his teacher concerning this and it did not go anywhere.","I am happy with CCA .","I would like to feel the IEP meetings were better prepared for by the staff.

No comments here.","I can only compare the curriculum to one I know from being with K12 for 4 years. The things I loved were the Language and History program. The science program and math programs were comparable, however, CCA's science seems to be in constant repeat mode. I had seen it last year when my kids were all learning almost the same things in 2nd, 4th, and 6th grade and I see it this year in 3rd, 5th and 7th grade. It seems like they aren't really learning more things, just the same thing in a different way. I never noticed this with my other school. The phonics program at K12 is amazing and is the reason why I chose not to enroll my newest Kindergartener in CCA and instead enrolled her in PAVCS to utilize the K12 phonics. She was struggling to get her letters before and now is a great reader, I believe because of the Phonics program. The History program is excelled in the K12 curriculum. I love that they teach world history and Greek mythology as a story. It doesn't overwhelm the child like you would think. It's spoken as a story in a book. Children love stories and they see the stories as fun. I miss the LA and History from the K12, but I love the EdTech and field trips of this school and CCA has much better contact with families, so I have stayed. However, if there would be a change of curriculum coming soon, I'd love to see you have K12 as an option (maybe have more than one curriculum to choose from like some other cyber schools I've talked with), but in keeping with some kind of program that would also allow the students to learn the world of Microsoft, like the EdTech program. It would be amazing to have my cake (the curriculum) and eat it too (the amazing staff at CCA). Thank you for this opportunity to tell you my feedback.","Well, I know that you are separate from Connections Academy now and I truly believe that the K12 younger years program is superior to the Connections. In LA and History especially. I have used 4 different cyber school curriculums throughout my children's school years and I have found that the Phonics program though K12 is amazing. My last two children (I have 5 students and a 3 year old) have started in PAVCS with the K12 program solely because of their Phonics program. These two children have started the Kindergarten year with not really understanding the difference between all their letters and numbers. They call 6 a letter and A a number. They didn't know all their letters and had no understanding of how to form words. Within 6 weeks in the Phonics program, the change was amazing, and my \"now 2nd grader\" is a fluent reader. My kindergartener, who started this year, is well on his way to being an excellent reader as well. If there is anything I would change about CCA, it would be allowing the use of the K12 program and OLS system as an alternative to the curriculum it uses now. That way, I could have all my students (Again, I have 6 children total) in the same school, but be able to decide which curriculum would be best for each child. That would be the perfect school. I do understand that that would mean having teachers trained in both curriculums and possibly have a double set of staff for the K12 curriculum so that you could also offer content based classes, but you asked, and that would literally be a dream come true. My local school district actually has an online school that allows the choice of Connections and K12 and I have been tempted to switch, but the content based classes and the collection of teachers holds me from doing that. I do not believe that I would get the attention for my kids that I believe is important, utilizing the local school districts online school. I have mentioned the K12 curriculum to everyone who asks my opinion. Thank you.","I wish the curriculum was easier for iep students. I wish the assignments wouldn't stack up, it's very overwhelming. I also wish they were more specific to their needs. I feel that the curriculum is to hard for slower students. I also hate the fact that they have to go to the message boards for modified assignments. Everything NEEDS to be in one spot to make it easier for students with special needs and parents also. The assignments are not modified enough.","I wished that it was clear to me of the expectation of the course, it is so easy to fall behind it you struggle with test then the lessons pile up because you are restricted to move on then you wind up with overdue lessons.  So you are forever playing catch up.","I would like to see more field trips offered in our area","I felt like some of the teachers were a little easy on grading writing and projects. Others were tough, but fair.","Keep doing what you are doing!!","They do a great job all ready.","I don't have anything to request.","do a great job","No answer","eliminate Ed Tech for students who are doing well in all courses. My children and I feel that this course is very redundant","CCA has been great!  Only difficulty we have had is when contacting support for technical issues.  The help from technical support has not always been the best.","One way would be in the LL's,the teachers need to teach what is in that particular lesson.When that is not done it makes you have to choose, a much longer school day or not really going over that lesson in as much detail as you could have.We are big fans of LL's and attend daily,if it matched up better, i bet you would have more students attending. And i think if possible CCA needs to bring back Hersey Park trip,kids love to meet teachers and see other kids that attend,and it gives kids something to look forward to.","Iam happy with everything","No answer.","Continue the wonderful communication it already has. It is more than we ever received in brick and mortar public school.","Not sure.","I feel as if certain classes can be reworked and tailored toward the grade level relevant. For example, Social Studies and Art for Kindergarten students, for the most part is okay, but it has way too many videos that are not geared toward this age group and my son loses interest quickly. We have been able to find youtube videos and websites that help with some of these issues, but that has been my only concern throughout the year. I would love to see videos for the folklore section of this grade level as well. I found some videos on youtube for that class with my son and he loved them and got the references throughout that section right away with the rest of his work because of it. We really enjoy this school and the education programs it has to offer, the issues stated would be our only concern.","NONE","Better communication with parents and a better understanding within the organization of roles.

There needs to be  some help...My son is suffering after being very sick and now is so far behind he feels lost...with no end in sight. An honor student failing.","Better communication","provide testing for special education in a more reasonable time frame, provide more variety in Electives, not \"push\" college and career planning-college is not for every student !","The main reason that we are not returning next year is the dramatic decrease in the quality and number of field trips. The ones that are offered are subpar and not usually garnering enough interest from my student to make it worth the time to go. Combine that with no more end of year picnic and public school has too many advantages over CCA where that didn't used to be the case","There will always be things we don't like in any situation, but I feel that overall, we are well supported and when we need anything, we have been able to contact someone who has been very helpful!","It would be beneficial if there were more detailed help with learning to write well. Also, I find it difficult to balance having to hand-hold my kids to get their work done and letting them be responsible for completing tasks in a timely manner.","As far as the rules for the Community Reimbursement there needs to be rules in writing to give direction on what is reimburseable and what is not.","Keep on doing what you are doing.","I think CCA has a great foundation, however, there are some building blocks that need to be added to the foundation.  Communication is extremely important when your student is working in a virtual environment.  The teens in school today are very comfortable with technology, but very uncomfortable when it comes to picking up a phone and calling a teacher for help.  I have spoken with several parents recently and have found this to be true with both sons and daughters.  This generation does not want to ask for help and it almost paralyzes them to speak with someone on the phone.  They would rather speak face to face or use texting for communication.  I think it would be helpful for teachers to be staying on top of their students' grades and when they see that a student is falling behind, or has been struggling with quick checks, quizzes, or tests, the teacher should be reaching out to the student. (not waiting for the student to reach out to the teacher - that might not EVER happen)  \n\nHigh school students need to know that their teachers care about them and about their future - not that they have someone just trying to teach them something.  I think it would be helpful for \"regular\" LiveLessons - even when it is an \"elective\" type of class.  My daughter is in Sign Language and has been waiting 3 years to take that course - she was so excited to finally be a senior and get to take Sign Language.  However, she should not be teaching herself Sign Language. . . . . that's where the teacher needs to step in.  Having a LiveLesson 1 time in 4 weeks is not very practical.  At the very minimum, she should have 1 lesson with a teacher per week.  She spends several hours a week doing the work for that class but doesn't have any feedback, or any \"Live\" person/teacher to be speaking with about it. That's when being in a classroom in a building with a teacher would far outway cyber learning.  It's difficult to maintain that balance.","N/a","I think CCA does a fantastic job.","Live lessons for science and social studies in Kindergarten","n/a",":)","I find it confusing when the home page lists a student as approaching alarm when there has been contact and live lessons attended.","I do very much appreciate the  Work internship program.  That is also why my daughter is staying her senior year, for that opportunity (I forgot to mention).\nSo, I would say to continue growing that opportunity for the students to really do hands on work, which I think helps them decide what kind of job they may enjoy doing after schooling is done.\nMake more connections w/ job places to have more options lined up/easily accessible in different fields of interest for the students to apply for - in the work program/conservatory.\nMy daughter would probably also request more photography, or 'techy' type classes. As she pretty much took all classes offer re: to photography.\nOther wise, keep doing what you are doing!:)\nAnother thought -Graduation - maybe somehow make it more personal. Maybe a 'get together' of the graduating class in a certain area of PA to actually meet/social.??

My daughter only went on 2 field trips this year (which is fine), but there were several field trips the same month that were of interest to her.  She was not allowed to attend both (even if we paid for one of them) because of this policy.  For next year, please consider having a yearly limit of field trips for students, so they could potentially take several the same month, if many of the field trips on the other months do not interest them.","Have seminars or classes for parents and students to come to so they can learn about the college process.\n\nAlso, re-evaluate the current field trip policy","I have been very satisfied with CCA.","Provide more guidance to students in high school.  I feel like my child is floundering - not sure what to do after school.  It would be helpful to have some classes for high school age students to talk about careers, schools, doing resumes, job interview practice, etc.  The STEM activities have been of help in some areas, but this year they seemed shorter, or farther away, and we were unable to get to most of them.  Several were over an hour away, so it is hard to travel that far for a STEM class that lasts 3 hours.  Harrisburg is a good area to have the STEM classes, and we still have a 50 minute drive (but very willing to go there), but several were north of Reading - over 1.5 hours away!

While I understand that most advanced classes start in 3rd grade, there are exceptions to the rule, and some children will lose their curiosity and eagerness to learn if they are bored and not challenged.

Also with him being in grade K.

I'm not sure if the friend wasn't doing what was expected or if the school's expectations and requirements of the student lessen in junior high.  I also hear that the science program is not independent learner centered and everything is taught from the classrooms. This type of structure will not work for my daughter as she learns from hands-on experience.  I would appreciate information prior to next year so that we can make adjustments where necessary.","you guys are great, my son can be difficult sometimes to do his works, but the teachers are great and understanding...","We are doing fine and my child is learning a lot more than she would in private schooling.","I think CCA is doing a wonderful job","The quality, close proximity, and variety of field trips is dwindling from past years.  Although the field trips are now coordinated across the areas of the state, there are considerably less unique experiences.  Opportunity to enjoy experiences as a family has been taken away with the reduction of learning coaches from 2 to 1.  I would prefer to be able to pay for extra field trips when they don't fill up.  Some months we might like to take more trips, and others we are too busy for any, a more versatile field trip management system could be advantageous.  With the change in STEM Conservatory events this year, and bringing them under the 1 paid umbrella idea, we were only able to attend one this year.  They had been a highlight for my older child the previous year and he attended most of them.  The duration was usually 9am-3pm, like a regular school day, which we prefer and the drop off format.  I have lots of ideas I could share to expand deeper learning experiences and ways the school could offer specific perks for certain age groups without increasing cost by a great amount.","fewer portfolios.  In the learning process I understand projects are needed, but the number of portfolios in the elementary curriculum is ridiculous.  Especially, kindergarten,","Offer activities in Philadelphia that are of high interest on a regular basis, like culinary and theater.","more inter active lessons.","You have been extremely helpful to my grandson. I am his coach and always check his work at the end of the day ,to make sure he is staying on top of things. The teachers are great. Just wish there were not so so many portfolios all due at the same time in each subject. It can be overwhelming for the student.","Just keep doing what your doing. This school is great!","Allow asynch students to have access to live lessons if there is a need. I understand that they are asynch because they do not attend live lessons, but access to recordings from another teacher would be great in case there is a lesson or two the student would like to watch. \n\nAlso, I prefer the previous years' way of handling field trips. Only one paid per month is difficult when there are so many my students would like to do. There are many field trips being cancelled because of lack of interest. It is a shame that the students who would like to go on them can't because they are limited to just one field trip.","Not sure. Everything has been great.","OOps I mentioned this already, but having some kind of meet up activities with other CCA kids in the Lancaster area on a regular basis (maybe at the Lancaster City library or a public park like Lancaster Central Park (maybe for nature walks/learning/writing in science journals) would be great.","if the teacher could start texting a students that has cell phones, students may reply quicker.","through out the many years you all have been extremely helpful .it is a great school with many great and caring teachers. (especially if student has some health issues).  thank you all","It would be much more enjoyable if the students didn't have so many portfolios. The amount of portfolios (and the amount of time the majority of them take) is getting crazy. Plus they seem to clump and be several in one week. I would also love to have more notice when a portfolio is modified or dropped. Cyber schools are supposed to provide flexibility. It is almost impossible to work ahead because of the portfolio modifications and when they are dropped. It is not fair for students that work ahead.","Very happy with the contacts I have made with staff as well as the curriculum.","We are very satisfied","CCA does a good job listening and finding solutions; I feel very happy because I feel that I'm part of a team.","I think the high school classes should be more frequent.  I believe they need live lessons at least 4 days a week in all subject areas.","I can't think of anything at the moment.  We are really satisfied with the program.","no comments","Better and timely communication with staff and administration.  I have a special needs student and communication though a bit better  lately has been terrible.  Teachers have been a bit better than working with administration.     This year has been down right frustrating.  In prior years communication was excellent.    I have been greatly disappointed.  My son attended CCA  grades 1,2 and 5, the communication at the elementary level was fantastic.  My son gets to middle school,6th grade,  everything falls apart.  It looks like one talks to each other and then also doesn't get back to the parent.   I hope it will improve for the coming school year.","To be able to contact the staff when needed with out always leaving messages and waiting for return phone calls.","CCA has been a wonderful experience for my daughter, they have done everything in their power to make sure she is able to graduate on time!","As of right now I am very satisfied with CCA","It works as-is","Can't think of anything. We are very satisfied.","Have a history an science class for learning support kids.","For now, CCA has done more than I ever imagined for my son and my family.  Because CCA goes above and beyond, I'm enrolling my daughter for next year to start Kindergarten.  I have given CCA's information to many people in many different situations.","It is sad to see how much of the flexibility is gone. When we started it was much easier to move at our own pace now if you don't follow the teacher exactly you may find you have done the wrong project(portfolio) or that the assignment has been changed. Schedules and lessons should be set at the start of the semester and any changes noted. There may be a reason a student works ahead (medical problem, family issues, vacation different from CCA schedule) This has been made very difficult and it used to be very easy. Daily live lessons are nice but if you attend all live lessons, many days 4-5 there is little time to complete work not covered unless you do 8 hour school days. One of the reasons for switching to CCA was to shorten my child's day (No bus ride, time lost o lunch and changing classes) I understand the school day should be 5-6 hours but when you are spending that much time in live lesson per day without completing the lesson it drags the day out to easily 7-8 hours. More flexibility would definitely be better.","One suggestion would be to offer more opportunities for the children to get together. I often hear children speaking about the difficulty of making friends and socializing. There are MANY wonderful places in our town that offer free, fun, educational experiences! Another suggestion would be to allow the teachers to have a high amount of input regarding the curriculum. Many of these teachers have been with CCA for years and I believe they have earned your trust and should be given the freedom to teach and test in the best way they know how.","CCA does a good job","Provide more choices in Humanities classes.","Not sure","Better curriculum for foreign languages.","The questions on the tests need to be more clear. They are too confusing especially in Math when they can take the question more than one way. Pictures for measuring need to be from the side not offset diagonally so they don't know how long it is. The questions on things need to be more specific.","Make more field trips available in Montgomery County. This year we didn't get many at all. I also have an issue with the current way that paid field trips are dealt with. I understand the school can only pay for one trip per month per child but I think that if a family is willing to pay for another one then they should be allowed to pay for the whole thing in order to go. At times there are field trips scheduled in a month in two different areas that are paid for that would be good for my children but because we cannot go to more than one we have to chose. This issue needs to be addressed. I have heard this complaint from other families also so I know I am not the only one.","Everything is fine right now, we just enrolled in program about 1 month ago","Not a thing I can think of right now.","I am very happy.","I wrote an email addressing my concerns and was never acknowledged or answered, not even with a basic form letter, which is very unprofessional. Spoke to someone in admin who promised to add more field trips in our area (free and paid), that didn't happen. No one in the administration of CCA appears to care about addressing concerns other than through placating lip service.","I feel CCA is perfect!","I am happy with everything at this time.\n","Better study guides.\nBetter consistency between modified tests and on-line versions of tests for kids with an IEP.\nBetter communication from staff ( I was not notified that my son's learning support teacher was no longer his LST!). \nMore tools tailored for kids with IEPs. Specific, targeted study guides; visuals; simplified words to help kids better understand what they read,","I am very happy with CCA at this time.","We love CCA and since we are fairly new, we feel we are being served appropriately.   Thank you!","The course content needs to be addressed. In our course there is a place to make comments on that specific lesson. I am told people read them, but I have never seen any changes. For instance, last year and this year, I have requested a comment box in the drop box for portfolios. In some cases, I need to make a quick comment to the teacher about my child's project. If a comment box was there, the teacher would see the comment when they were grading the project. Instead I need to separately email the teacher and then they need to go into the drop box to see what I need. It is extra work. There have been several science projects that were not planned correctly in the seasons. For instance one was to use 3 different soils (not provided) and no stores carried all of these. In the spring or end of fall they would, not winter.","My biggest complaint is the curriculum. I think it needs some work. Now that my oldest have been here for 3 years and we had experience 2 years at a K-12 school, I realize I like the K-12 curriculum better. I think CCA is far better overall. However, for science and social studies, we seem to be going over the same things every year. I noticed this year that my gifted daughter in 4th barely reads science because she knows it already. Science is not her favorite subject so she doesn't do extra work on her own. I understand it builds on each other, but I wish there was more. Art and science experiments seem exactly the same. For instance both my 1st and 4th grade had to make pinch pots. 4th grade have been asked to design something more involved.  This year 4th grade had to have PA state history which was a great idea, but this class was designed for HS students. There was too much information given, even I couldn't remember it all. It overwhelmed my gifted student and I know all levels of kids had to take this class. When we were in K-12 we learned about actual roman history and greek mythology. It was too much for 1st grade but this would be good for older students. Also, the book selection this year for reading was way off. The 4th grades were given an easy read picture book of Into the Sea, which they are reading now at the end of the year. It takes 5 minutes to read. However, this is after them getting a chapter book of the Mixed Up Files. The easy book should have been in September. Also, I did not like the Mixed Up Files. Have you read it? There is too much talk of a boys underwear and privates, 2 pages on a Marijuana joint, and the kids ran away from home and nothing bad happens to them. I don't need something tragic, but they don't even get in trouble or feel as if they are sorry. There are so many other books to read. I didn't realize this but after talking to other parents, their kids didn't need to complete these lessons. They complained. It was skipped.","I have noticed a lot of common core lessons integrated into the lesson plan.  These lessons are not included in the answer key to the learning coach.  The teachers also do not have access to the answers to these lessons.  I would like to see the answer key for these lessons included in the teaching materials.\n\n2 day lessons are very confusing and cumbersome in Connexus.  It would be easier to just have it set up as two lessons instead of simply telling you that you have two days to complete the lesson.\n\nSince flexibility is important to me and my family, I would like to see more flexibility with check-in calls.  Having a late afternoon or evening option would be helpful.","Not having to log out of the student/parent to go to the parents/students website.  Allowing us to keep moving through all the lessons not having to stop for the B simestor.","CCA is meeting all of our expectations.","dropping all phapleio class projects","Many times what the teacher teaches does not match the assignment in the planner.  This has been an ongoing frustration and has led to several instances when my daughter is taking quizes with information not covered in class or reviews are done after the planner has her taking her test.  She has also had to webmail several teachers on several occasions to remind them about uploading lessons, extra credit that was completed, but not credited, and follow through on study island problems.","Way to many portfolios and they count for to high of the grade.","Keep doing what you are doing.  Completely satisfied with CCA.","Get your teachers to return webmails  and calls","None","CCA can open a location in the Allentown/Bethlehem area, to make it easier for those of us living in these towns, who are not able to travel to the other locations. It will help our students who live in these towns to have access to teachers, administrators, tutors, special events going on within the school, and other students.","At this time I do not have any comments.","Keeping up the good work with the students","They cant because they serve me very well now","CCA is great","The \"alarm\" status is a pain in the but.  It seems like no matter how many live lessons my child attends or how on target we are , we are always in alarm and the response time after telling someone takes up to a week, if at all!\n","Increase communication between Administrators and Teachers.","I have no complains","Qick responces","You're doing a great job.","I'm truly satisfied","So far I can't think of anything.","Have car pooling to field trips for families without transportation.","My daughter needs a special education cuz she has adhd is really hard for her to learn is the first time that her grades falling like this in regular school she has A , B or C and I am worried about her grades now.","When we first started looking at Cyber schools the biggest issue was finding a school that didn't depend on common core.  My son is in special education and he just doesn't get it , no matter how often it is explained.  This year is math is entirely common core and he is struggling.  We have to relearn and explain things to him EVERY DAY so he can do it the common core way.   When I teach him the way I was taught he \"gets it\".  I think he should be graded on can he do the math..... NOT can he do the math the common core way.   Two totally different things.","Just help me get through the year with my child.","Have more learning centers around me.","I don't feel there are any other ways CCA could better serve me.","By helping my son get as much help he can get.","my daughter has ADHD is hard for her understand instructions and her grades are really bad never she has this issues before also she always have good grades. I hope that you guys help me with it.","Some teachers need to have better availability.","I would love it if CCA could help facilitate more interaction among students so that there could be a bit more social engagement.","Connect families of kids in similar grades or classes so there could be an option to do a science lab together or study together from time to time.  This has been isolating even though our familiar coordinators have tried to gather families.  It would just be nice to know if a child in my child's classes lived nearby.","At this time I am fully satisfied with CCA and the education he is receiving.","I don't think there is any aspect that needs improvement.","I am very satisfied with CCA- I cannot think of any aspect that needs improvement.","More live lessons throughout the day.","I am extremely satisfied with every aspect of CCA.","I have a few concerns about my families whole experience with CCA.","It would be nice if there were more student contact with the teachers and more of an incentive for my student, who has some social anxiety, to engage with their online classroom.  With that being said, CCA's flexibility has allowed an non gender-conforming teen to continue their high school education as they go through some difficult years of self-realization.  Our own public high school offers an online option, but no teachers, no honors courses, and no AP courses- so CCA was perfect for a smart, motivated student going through a difficult time.","Just keep doing what they're doing, I am very happy with everyone and the interest they show for my children.","you guys do fine now","Get rid of those iready tests! They are too frequent and not suited for most childrens grade level. My child is very intelligent, gifted, and it is ridiculous to ask an 8 year old about a 12th grade statistics problem in the math iready. These tests are not assessing grade level. They are a fishing expedition to see if a child can guess correctly under duress.","Unsure. Doing a great job","Nothing everything is perfect","Psychologists should not be afraid to use words like dyslexia. If a child has dyslexia they should say it in the evaluation and IEP documents.","I can't think of anything to write here.  Everything has been great for us.","The availability of field trips in our region is limited. It would be nice to have more opportunities for local trips.","N/A","I think the curriculum could be changed a little. There should be more online interactive content that can be graded and less portfolios and quizzes and quick checks.","Not really sure what they do is already enough in my opinion","Not sure","You could simplify the field trip enrollment process as I explained in a previous question.  There are also certain field trips that get more interest than others so that not everyone gets an opportunity to participate.  Perhaps you could offer those trips more than once each year so that everyone who wants to participate would get a chance.  Obviously you would only allow students to go on the same trip once each year.  (for example - DaVinci Center, Crayola Experience)\nYou also need to find a better PA History class that includes a text book.  The PA History class for the fourth grade was horrible!","I think there needs to be more opportunity for live tutoring. I think that given how big the Lehigh Valley is we should have a center here and not Andreas. Would like to have the opportunity to have groups social skills in our area. I would also like to have an opportunity to drop off my child for learning experience where I don't have to be 100 there or nearby so I can have a break. It is challenging to be with your child 100 percent of the time especially if they are special needs.\n","I would love to see more choices for electives at both the high school level and especially middle school. We have had a very positive experience with the school so far and really don't have any major areas for concern. The Special Ed department is what makes this the right school for us. They have gone above and beyond to help my kids be successful!","Some of the teachers need to remember that this is a cyber school, kids are not in a regular classroom setting. Math teachers need to slow down a bit while they are teaching their lessons. Kids like to take notes and understand what they are doing in order to obtain good grades. Kids cannot accomplish that if the teacher does not give them the opportunity to do it.","I was this schools biggest cheerleader up until this year. Since separating from Connections Education, it seems like the teachers workload/student load has increased. We sometimes wait several weeks for things to be graded. My child's IEP has not been followed for 3 months now - they are not receiving related services in their IEP.","I loved everything about CCA last year 2015/2016 I had no complaints. This new structure of a flipped classroom for high school is awful this year for a special needs student. My son has stopped enjoying the academic part of school where he loved it. I have stopped recommending CCA based on this curriculum. This new team teaching is extremely disorganized. Most teachers are not following my son's IEP anymore.  If it goes back to the old way I would be happy to recommend once again.","Some teachers need to use effective learning strategies so students can learn faster and easier.","have more structured live lessons with the teachers that are assigned to my student. Too many live lesson options with different teachers can get confusing.","CCA is amazing. The teachers are great, the live lessons are extremely helpful, I couldn't ask for more.","It is nice of you to ask, but seriously, I can't think of anything. My child is thriving for the past five years. I wouldn't consider any other school. The environment because of the staff is always warm, respectful and highly supportive to all our needs.","My son struggles and I have asked for help for him on multiple occassions with no responses","Thank you for asking, but there isn't a thing better you can do to improve.","It was a great experience for our family this year and I'm so glad we gave it a chance\nI have no suggestions for making it better then it is.","we r new to this and I think a little more help to get started and to make sure we understand everything correctly","my child just got enrolled and received her computer there are 96 missed assignments for her to catch up on and no one really mad sure everthing was ok after enrollment was complete. the only teacher that contacted me was the math teacher and it is a little confusing just starting out it would e nice for a follow up from someone after the computer comes to make sure everthing is set up and understood","CCA has done a great job.","Reevaluate the need for so many portfolios.  Way too many per course per year!!!","The one struggle we've had this year is the antiquated Connexus system.  The web design is terribly poor and is not suited for the quality of computers issued.  This leads to a poor user experience for the students(&amp; parents).  Each lesson requires too much scrolling and panning.  The screen size is so small at times that you can not see questions and the multiple choice answers without scrolling back and forth.  User experience testing needs to be done to evaluate the system.  The poor web design is frustrating and compromises the validity of the school with its outdated system. \nAll programs should run in the browser, not requiring installation (ie:activity tracker, tux paint, etc.).","just continue what they are doing","Connexus needs an overhaul.  It is not user-friendly.  There are too many categories and oddly-named tabs.  It needs a search button on the main page.  I challenge you to do a user-experience test with someone who has no experience with the site.  There is a huge learning curve to finding things which makes it challenging for new families.  We are in our second year and I cringe when I have to locate something on the site.","Do not know","CCA meets my and my daughter's needs. I would like for her to attend field trips and social events but that is because she is shy about not knowing anyone, not because of lack of offerings. Is there a way to protect the confidentiality of the students while letting them get to know each other a little? I don't know.","I can't think of anything at this point!","Longer school days. They BARELY have any classes or work. They are not even given the mandatory 28 school hours per week.","Everything is good","nothing","Just continue to provide excellent teachers who respect parents, love their work, and want the best for our kids(their students).","Stop letting my daughter get so many lessons behind. Her mom does not make her maintain her lessons and she is constantly behind. She carries many zeros until the end of the semester and then tries to catch up. Your grading process and her mom's lack of concern reinforces these poor work habits she is developing.","I don't know.","N/A","I have a better stability from CCA than I did public school.  My son struggled to want to even leave the house due to nasty adult attitudes at public school.  He really likes his teacher here.  She also helps to remind that though he thinks it's bad that a grade drops: she reminds him some things are harder than others.  That it doesn't mean that grade will stay down.  It's really comforting to have wonderful personalities and help that is positive.","CCA is an excellent school. Improvement is needed for the live lesson recordings (which tend to freeze and continuously get stuck), and for the Discovery Education videos that could not be viewed in the lessons. My daughters look forward to the videos; they are disappointed when the videos do not work.","Nothing I can think of now","My children and I are very satisfied overall with CCA.","More special ed support for my daughter","I feel CCA is doing a good job providing for my children and their education.","Everything has always been great the past 3 years. This is the first year that we were disappointed. A teacher in my daughters Social Studies class was \"re-writing\" history telling the students that those involved in the tea party were bad people, and that the 2nd Amendment really doesn't mean what it says. Downing our Forefathers....The teacher also was telling the students that the black people arrested and treated unfairly by police are terrible police officers. (the latest stories/riots) She even named the names of those \"treated unfairly\" which is are controversial topics. This teaching is poison, instilling in these kids heads that policemen are horrible people.  She posted a song, \"One Nation Under a Groove\" When a student said that it is One Nation Under God, the teacher told the student that it wasn't true. There was more, but I can't think of it right now.  I was going to call in about this, but the teacher never posted these L.L., so I didn't have proof. (The teacher posted maybe 3-4 L.L. a month) I think that maybe a parent said something because the teacher now teaches at the school cubicle (we can hear other teachers) instead of home. Things have calmed down. For next year, I would love to see mandatory posting of L.L.each day from the teachers. I will admit, I was looking elsewhere for my child's education for next year. I've NEVER had problems in the past. I'm giving it one more year in hopes that teachers will be accountable to the school board in what they teach. Besides that, we have/had been extremely happy with the school in the past years.","Start teaching typing and keyboard placement before teaching different Microsoft programs.","Nothing that I know of.","I think one option that could be looked into is: Try to group children from class that are closer to each other in proximity (area wise) so they might be able to get together more locally. For instance, play dates in the park, or local library trips, or even groups to the movies. Optional of course, but it would be something to think about.","N/A","no comment","My son struggles with the curriculum and it takes a long time to get through assignments and we quickly fall behind.","you are doing an excellent job so far","I'm not sure I'm pretty happy","we never got to go on any of the field trips because they were never on my page can u help with that?","Our needs are being met. :)","Overall, we are very happy!","I absolutely love CCA.  The teachers and administration promptly return my emails and answer my questions.  The only issue I have right now is that some of my son's credits didn't transfer correctly and I haven't heard back from anyone.  I will  just try to call again.","I do not like the courses like Intro to Computers &amp; Tech (IC3), where the teachers are out of state and do not hold livelessons.  This has been an extremely difficult class, with NO modifications (my daughter has an IEP).  I wish more courses weren't so \"reading heavy\" . . . there should be more interaction within a lesson.","I am very happy with CCA.","More live lessons later in the day","Counselor response could be faster and more formal.  My child will be a senior next year and the major thing I am worried about is the counselors involvement in the college application process as current response time to emails and how they are just one liner responses does not seem professional and makes me nervous as counselors are a key part in the application process","n/A","The administrators and staff (eg. AAs) seem very overwhelmed to me.  Paperwork takes a very long time (often months) and phone/email responses can also take a long time.  Perhaps more staff is needed?\nI also felt the field trip quality was lower this year.  Perhaps this is because my child is getting older and there is less available/appropriate choices for him; however, this spring in particular seemed to offer less options and more redundancy overall.","I have always liked CCA and so have my children but this year we were a little disappointed in the teachers not all the teachers just some.","Thanks for all you do! \n\nThe one thing I would love to see return is the reimbursement of college classes (dual-enrollment).","It already is a great school","Wish a mentor could of came to our house to help with the beginning process","doing fine","more activities near bucks county","simply update the homepage regularly with any and all relevant information","I believe this kind of school is ok for some children but not for others","I would like to know who my kids guidance counselors are.  My kids have some LDs and I have been unable to find out where and how to get help.","i am satisfied","I think that more placement services should be utilized zed so that the children are not doing repetitive work when transitioning from public.

Thank you.","More local trips so the kids can meet.","The amount of portfolio projects were overwhelming!  These were very labor intensive and time consuming for my 2 third graders and it was extremely difficult to keep up with the sheer number of these.

Less portfolio projects for elementary grades.","The Special Education Department needs to support my child's academic needs that have been clearly identified.","I think CCA should have newly enrolled families broken into 2 categories. Families who are new to homeschooling and families who aren't. As a family who has been homeschooling for some years, I feel that the communication and phone calls are very overwhelming. I get that the school wants to help, but the constant calls are annoying and it takes us away from what we are doing.","CCA should really consider dropping the number of portfolio's. They can be overwhelming, and they throw us off track. Also, I don't think my child's grade should be affected if he doesn't do skills tutor. If he doesn't do it, but does well with the work itself, his grade is lowered, when he does do it however, he doesn't receive any kind of extra credit for it. CCA also needs to think about adding more courses for high school. This is the main reason my 8th grader won't be back. There are not enough courses to choose from to keep her interested for 4 years.","Continue to offer support to the children and to the parents as well.","We have been with CCA, for a long time now.

In short too much detail. The direction on a particular lesson should be more in bullet form. This will create more independence for children and less confusion.","No concerns.","Helping her with the transition of leaving here and going to a tech school, for anime art.","deadline for homework be longer as my daughter has  IEP and needs extra time to do it","Have better programs for helping children with anxiety disorders.","Help us get ready for college and apply for scholarships","You guys ROCK and are doing an awesome job!!","The equipment is my only problem having laptops without webcams the having to attach camera and the camera breaks or the laptop stops functioning I really think it is a time to upgrade there equipment\n",null,"I can't think of anything.","1. A way to work on the road - make the LLs compatible with mobile devices, ipads, kindles, phones. CCA should SUPPLY DATA SERVICE so that we can continue to do work on laptops and attend live lessons while traveling to and from Drs. appts/therapy and field trips. 2. Inform teachers that many us enrolled our children in CCA for the flexibility, otherwise we would be in a B&amp;M. They shouldn't penalize kids for working ahead (we lost 25 pts the first week of school for doing a quick check), or penalize kids for not attending LLs by only announcing important info during class. Teachers need to utilize their message board and should give changes/drops in a timely manner (dropping Ports a day before they are due - again penalizing students that work ahead or just want to get a head start). 3. Ports should show up the day you start them instead of the day due, allowing students to work on them and continue doing their daily work. 4. Let LCs know where students should be in the course opposed to where they actually are or SAY they are. Turn the lesson on the calendar or Course Tree RED. The teachers kept telling the kids to ignore their scheduler, just follow along with LLs - the scheduler was useless this year. 5. A better website would be great. Something more cohesive, where you could get to everything CCA from one page. 6. My niece is thinking of doing B&amp;M for 9th-12th because High School at CCA seems like such a mystery and scary. I'm even anxious about the major changes between MS and HS. We are already testing and applying to several schools. Give us reasons to stay. 7. We love Field Trips, keep working at making them better and do a better job of selling them to the parents. Allow us to attend more paid trips if spots are still open/if we pay. STEM trips should always be open to all. 8. If we travel to field and stem trips, are we eligible for discounted Public Transportation fares like B&amp;M offers? This would be great for those that can't or won't drive.","I'm happy with everything","In a perfect world, I'd live close to one of the drop-in centers, so my child could work alongside other CCA students on projects, homework, etc. (and have somebody besides just me reminding him to get things done). After 3 years, my student has definitely gotten in a \"home school\" groove, and transitioning back to brick-and-mortar school, or even to a workplace, will be more difficult.","By replacing the portfolios with something else, they are too intense and there are too many back to back tests and quizzes, I know I can run the scheduler to change things but in the end they all need to be completed and it's a bit overwhelming.  I work from home and I like for my 4th grader to get his work done during normal school hours, not later after I am done work or on the weekends because we all need time to relax. So I find myself doing 2 jobs, working from home and continuously needing to monitor my son to be sure he is not skipping past work and needing to help him with things he may be having trouble with which that is what I am suppose to do but it's tough when I have to meet my work obligations also at the same time---so CCA seems to be geared more for non-working parents.","The portfolios can be a bit much &amp; during PSSA or Keystone season not give as many lessons so children can study for those test.","Unsure at the moment","We have very few complaints.  Those I had were taken to Mr. Fraser and together we worked them out. I can't thank CCA enough!  Cyber school is pretty much our only answer between my disability and my children's abilities. This is our first year dealing with the gifted department. Until now, abilities were addressed through promotion to the next level or modifying curriculum.  We had some issues with the teacher, but they are still being addressed with Mr. Fraser.Recommendations I could make would be - more Live Lessons (enrichment?) for those who are ahead with lessons or above grade level, study skills &amp; time management (I'm actually teaching my children this myself since it's clear they now need it). My disability keeps us from field trips during the winter months when my pain is at its worst. While I appreciate the field trip policy of one paid trip per month, it would really help us if we could bank field trips on the months we are housebound due to my health and then use those banked days during the spring months when we can travel. I know this will probably never happen, but I have to share my thoughts especially since I know other parents at CCA with similar health problems.  I would like to see a program where there is less waste when it comes to school supplies being sent out. We have years when we get the same kits for math and science or head phones that we already have.  We put them aside for if they're needed, but this does seem to create a situation where money could be spent more wisely. I had criticism about my 1st grader's mid-year testing that I webmailed Mr. Fraser and her teacher about previously. I would be happy to share that webmail if requested.","Make it so the lessons in the planner coincide with live lessons so that my child can work through them during the live lessons instead of doing both. My daughter enjoys LLs, but because she still has work to do in the workbook, textbook, Skills Tutor, portfolios, studying for tests, assessments, etc. she often has to do schoolwork on weekends and feels like she's working all the time. She's in ballet 9-12 hours a week, and while we like the flexibility, doing both the live lessons and lessons in the planner, she almost never has days off. She's exhausted, and I'm exhausted too. I have heard that other teachers do things differently, so maybe it's a teacher thing.","Tutors would be a blessing and my child would get much needed help on focusing.","They need to offer more trade school curriculum to prepare them for a non-collegiate education.","We are happy with the service.","I would like to see more practice in all subjects.","N/A I'm satisfied.","I am completely satisfied with CCA nothing needs to change.","Better communication throughout the school year including prior to the start of school.

There didn't seem to be enough time in the school day to complete everything. Perhaps cut back on some of the lesson activities in each lesson.","Every thing is great.","The multi-teaching program is not working very well in all of the subjects. This program creates confusion at times with different opinions when grading in English for writing paragraphs.","More contact from the teachers.","- Make the class trip message boards easier to navigate, and have more trips in lower bucks county.  - Try to follow traditional public school calendars for days off (a full week off for spring break, for example).  - Try to make the lessons less overwhel","Better software and hardware. The technology lags behind at tims and slows down the learning process.","am ok","Right now keep doing what you are doing.","Update the computers/laptops students use.","Continue this learning style.","There is one thing I really dislike and that is the portfolios. Some of them are okay, but some are very, very confusing, complicated and take up entirely too much time. I don't like it when my kids can't go forward until they complete the portfolio; they tend to get too far behind and it's overwhelming for them.","If a child completes the A portion of a class and then transfers to a different class and does not take the B portion, their A portion grades should not disappear or become irrelevant. They received a semester grade and it should stand.","Provide more vocational and home economics classes.","Build a staff that's invested in the best educational experience for each child and their families.","it is fine","There are several things that need to change.  First, make sure all of your teachers have degrees and actually know how to teach the subject that you place them in charge of. Second, get rid of the teachers who are not teaching and seem to care not one bit about whether the children are learning or if the parents are happy with their learning style. Specifically, Ms. Lauren Brady the 4th grade Gifted Talented teacher, has no business teaching. She has poor grammar, and thinks laughing will make her appear to be less of a fool. She needs to go. Also, Mrs. Nicole Oechler, a 6th grade teacher, has poor contact with parents and students, does not make phone calls, and takes extremely too long to respond to emails sent to her. Lastly, I think that if you want children to better grasp the material, you should stop teaching these strange new styles which expect children to best estimate an answer instead of solid actual responses. There are also assessments in which children are expected to choose the correct answer on an assessment in which the question is based on an opinion. This is a major problem that I have seen is ongoing. The assessments are not based on factual answers, they are based on whomever wrote the test's own personal opinion. Once someone actually takes the time to get these problems corrected, there will be a lot more learning, and far fewer issues to deal with throughout the school year.","It would be nice if someone would have reached out and offered the opportunity for our 9th grade student to take the SAT.  I have heard nothing about the National Honor Society and my son is a straight A student, athlete, and involved with the community.  I am unsure what the guidance counselors actually do since none of them have ever reached out to our family in all of the years we have been with CCA but especially now that my child is in high school.  What services does CCA offer that makes it a better choice than other cyber charters?  I find it very disappointing that as a parent of a CCA student I am never reached out to and I am involved in nothing any more.","CCA has been the perfect solution to our family situation. My son is a pre professional dancer and CCAs flexibility allowed him to keep up with his training and was awarded a total of $148,000 in college scholarships. This WOULD NOT have been possible at a traditional high school so CCA served us PERFECTLY!","I love cca","Fix some of there teachers","Make sure all teachers are there for the right reason.Make sure they aren't saying negative things to students","Our experience with orientation was non existant. We drove in the rain for about 2 hours only to get there and be told to go online and figure it out. The computer for my son to learn how this way of schooling goes wasn't working properly so I was taken through quickly and told to go on and start reading and I'd be good. We are still figuring things out. About the only thing my son got out of the trip was that we were told that a live lesson counts as an hour and the lesson / assessment for the day counts for an hour, no matter how long it actually takes. So it is a fight all the time between us that a 20 minute live lesson amd a 20 minute 5 question assessment isn't enough work for the day.\n  I will probably keep my son in CCA next year, but mainly because of the electives, which are way better than the district school, and we have a friend of my sons signing up next year, so hopefully they can work together and improve their understanding of the process and the subjects. \n  I also am totally confused about the whole \"Alarm\" system. It makes absolutely no sense to me. And although my sons homeroom teacher tries to justify it, I still don't get it. She says that its better interaction with the teacher, but if he doesn't ask questions and she doesn't call on him for an answer then it seems to me that it is the same as watching the recorded lesson. \n  I put my son in this environment because he doesn't ask questions, he seems intimidated by the teachers so I thought that not actually being there would help. A few of his teachers do call when they see him struggling, but he will never initiate a call to talk to his teachers, again because of his being intimidated.           Matt is a very bright kid but you can't tell from his grades, but they were no different at his home school and he has a better elective oppurtunity at CCA.  That is not how I wanted to feel about this experience, that its no better than his district school, I really wanted this to be all it was hyped up to be.\n  Personally I think that there are alot of extra carricular activities that don't benefit my son, maybe others get more out of it, I wish he had more \"time\" with instruction from his teachers, how many field trips does 1 kid need. They go on 1 field trip a year in our district, personally that is not a draw for us. I'd like to see more instruction from the teachers. Most of his classes don't even have daily live lessons, so the 20 minute assessment is the only instruction daily and that just isn't enough.  But because my son was told that that 20 minutes counts as an hour he feels like it's enough, then he struggles on his tests.\n  I was expecting more.","The teachers can write back to you faster","na","I put my son in cyber school because he doesn't ask for help where needed. It was my understanding that the teachers would contact him via webmail if they see he is struggling. I don't expect every teacher to contact every student every day, but if they see him struggling then reach out to him. If he doesn't respond, contact the coach. Some teachers put a response on t he quizzes and tests telling him what was right or wrong but that is after the fact.\nMy student had a bad experience early on with a teacher amd since then he struggles with trusting that they won't call him out or humiliate him because he has different opinions than the teacher, so I thought that since rhere is no \"classroom\" then he would feel safer, but that didn't happen, and yes I do consider that a teacher problem. I contact teachers with questions and they answer to me, not to the student.","I don't have any ideas; I think the way things are going now are just fine.","I am currently extremely satisfied but I miss the end of year field trip including all students and teachers","n/a","I can't think of any other way that CCA hasn't already thought of.

Having been a \"community coordinator\" in the first two years of my oldest child's years with CCA, I have seen the field trip program go through a variety of changes.  Many I imagine were to satisfy STATE requirements, but also to keep from losing so much money because unfortunately some families just are not as responsible as we would like them to be when registering for trips where money is attached.  But to be limited to only one paid trip per month.......I have a bit of a concern about that and hopefully will have the opportunity to speak directly with Jill Fraser about them.  She is absolutely wonderful and willing to hear all parents.  Also, I think that there should be more regular contact between students and the guidance counselors starting with the middle school.   We know that this is a transition period for students across all levels, home, school, personal.  And since CCA does a wonderful job recognizing that you cannot separate the school experience completely from what is happening at home, I just think a connection with students and the counselors should be more routine.  Other than that.....I am hard pressed to state how CCA could do any better by me.","I'm satisfied with all the help that I recieved.","It has been wonderful to me and my son so far","It'll be great to have a prompt response from the technical support, especially in the beginning of the school year.

She must be enrolled in a participating brick and mortar school to get into the tech school, that's why she will not be returning next year.

I think the Family Mentor program should be promoted a bit more.  I may look into tutoring options for what my child is struggling in, but that is in subject areas my child has trouble in, not due to problems with CCA. This is a challenge with special education, it can be more difficult for a child with learning differences to understand certain subjects, so I need to look into this.","I always get a responce when i ask about things.","Having separate literary magazines for K-8th and 9th-12th so mature content can be written by the older students, have more writing class choices, reinstating the writing club, making the pass/fail college/career class more relevant to prepared students (having them apply for scholarships as assignments, completing financial aid forms as assignments).  My daughter felt extremely censored by the lit magazine because of the age of the audience.  As high schoolers they should be able to write on mature age appropriate subjects.  My daughter had no real choices available for writing classes since none existed.  She would have enjoyed a novel writing, publication process class, itunes/ebook/amazon book publishing class.

My student felt he had been given the option for better opportunities for his future through enrollment at CCA. Once my student graduates he has plans to continue his education and eventually start a career in law enforcement. The curriculum is excellent and the teachers really care about the education of their students.  The administration/representatives are available for questions/comments, are very patient, and include parents in the decision-making process for the learning plans/courses assigned.","less emails very overwhelming","CCA could better serve the AP students by finding a way to accommodate for testing. It is not the easiest task to deal with the College board in reference to locating schools to take the test. Philadelphia Public school options were the worst as many had no idea who their AP coordinator was (or they were no longer there).  Some charter schools offering the exam had questions about why they should do it considering that they student does not attend there. It would also be helpful if the counselors and/or AP teacher (or another CCA staff member) took over this process. We were lucky enough to get a charter school to agree to let our daughter take the exam there however the process took several days and over 6 hours to get results. I almost felt like my child took an AP course did very well and now won't have the opportunity to take the exam. We were actually going to give up. Thankfully we already know of a school that would be willing to let her take the test there next year for the course she will be taking in 2016/2017. It would also be nice if CCA would consider if not a prom for high school students then some sort of spring formal to cover high school students. There are plenty of events schedule throughout the year I am not sure as to why this could not be considered an option. Many other cyber schools have them. Many students leave just for that experience. Some students reach out to try and attend at their local schools but it is not possible unless they attend with a current student. Yes students can play sports at other schools as per state law and CCA has plenty of clubs and field trips. However you guys definitely missed the ball on this one as there is not another option for students. Why not present a survey to gauge interest before the idea is cast aside? All and all we love CCA and will continue to recommend it to others without a doubt. We could not have been happier with our choice to remain apart of the CCA family.","An increase in the internet payment and to change the payment distribution time period. It's advertised that CCA will pay for internet service or it was advertise when my children were first enrolled. My daughter's computer has to stay plugged in at all times or it shuts off. It maybe little late for my daughter but CCA needs a penmanship curriculum added.","I would like more outings in my area.\n","Honestly... I just wished that I better understood the grading system..","CCA is doing a great job in serving our family.","Perhaps offer evening Live Lessons.","n/a","My children really enjoyed the \"Architecture/Interior Design Hands-on\" with Kurt Amen.

It is a total waste of time and only confuses the children.  I prefer the Calvert Curriculum to the Pearson Curriculum. \n\nI would like the school much better if there was not an excessive workload and the curriculum was not Common Core based.","I think there should be a 8 hour hand-on learning class for the new families, so we can get more familiar with the program. I think the program and the curriculum and the maneuvering in and out of the different areas are very confusing. New families need to know where to find the answers to the workbook questions. The books that the Caregivers get to assist the elementary school children doesn't even match the information in the computer. The assignments need to be more clear the Rubric versus the computer versus the book is too confusing the information doesn't coincide. I think to school should provide all the materials the student needs to complete the science experiments.","I would like to see my child evaluated at all levels because I want to be sure that learning disabilities are ruled out.","why bother to ask ?\nmy suggestions will not be implemented or heard or respected","More interactive learning.  I have a struggling student, but I definitely notice that my student loves hands-on activities and things that appeal to his interest.","CCA","they could have more session and phone call","It can reduce the workload and make it more manageable.  It can also provide more opportunities for socialization at the local level.  More events at the local offices that the students can attend.  More opportunities to make friends.","My child a senior this year and CCA has been great!

We used to do more field trips, but now that they seem to be broken down to more specific grades, it's harder to get there as a family.\n4.I feel the 8th grade should be recognized for their hard work.  I understand that they can't do a full graduation ceremony, but I think it would be wonderful if CCA could maybe just mail out a \"diploma\" and maybe send a video message from the 8th grade staff.\n5.Also I would LOVE a search feature in the webmail.","No they are excellent","Everthing is great.","I can't think of anything because you seem to cover everything already.","Make the portfolios that the students have to do a lot easier for the students to do them and give them more time to complete the portfolio.  Some subjects give a 2 or 3 day time period to complete a portfolio, but sometimes it takes longer to do them.  Any portfolio that is a research paper should not have to be 3-4 pages on a topic such as an author and a story that a student had to do another portfolio on, because there is no way to get 3-4 pages on some topics.  I think research portfolios should be on a topic that the student might be interested in and then the student will probably get 3-4 pages or more.","me (the student) actually sits down and does school work and I also want to learn more on CCA","I can't think of anything that you are not doing already.","With not making it so difficult for the kids overall to go up. I think it would help the students to push themselves to do even better seeing their overall go up at least alittle but they do there work the their overall score stays the same.","Have a math tutor help my son so he can finally graduate. Thank you Mr. Perrato for all your phone calls. He is a wonderful teacher.","No complaints except new testing, Iready and I ready math is to hard for the student most questions are things my student never learned. He stresses out before taking the test.","CCA served good overall","nothing your program is great","If a gifted advanced child comes to your school you should say in advance that you do not offer advanced classes for gifted support. I should have been told this before enrolling. Also the school selected his courses which are not even close to the electives and future he wants.

Or give me direction and guidance so that I can teach my child.  Her last school said that she should be in a Title One program but they didn't offer if.

Academics come before sports though.","N/A","n/a at this time","More direct contact with students","CCA could better serve me by clarifying what my role as a learning coach officially should be at each stage of the schooling process.  For example, what type of support I should provide to my future high school student after they transition from middle school.","I don't know how much more CCA can do to improve. My sons teacher is wonderful and when ever I had a tech problem the IT team was great.","Right now I can not think of a way CCA can better serve us.

CCA has been great.","I am satisfied with the program at this time.","CCA can better serve me by having an on site location to help when me and my child fall behind in work and we can go there to get help to get back on track","There should be different Live Lesson schedules for people with multiple children in different grades, so that all can attend at different times.  A parent should have other options when it comes to a grade that you don't agree with.  There should be someone else, who is objective, to come in and have an objective opinion concerning the issue.  Some of the problems on tests are very unfair and not grade appropriate and when an issue comes up, those questions should be addressed immediately.  Some of the teachers let the children in the chat pod control the class.  It's unfortunate that you have to sit and wait until the teacher chastises the student several times and finally puts the child out of the Live Lesson.  That's like the children having to suffer and not learn anything because someone is interrupting in a brick-and-mortar class.  There's no different.  The I-Ready test does not work correctly and needs to be scraped.  The teachers don't even give you the scores from the I-Ready tests, so what's the point?  My child was physically sick from taking the test.  My child had the same questions as their sibling who was 3 grades higher.  That is definitely a problem.  There are entirely too many portfolios and tests.  There is more to learning than spending days on a portfolio.","Please don't relax your standards or expectations of the students and families. The greatest benefit to our family is that my child has a challenging curriculum that keeps her college ready, in that she has real classwork she is responsible for everyday. She has learned so, so much about herself and the world around her. All three of my children have benefited from CCA. Your program has never given me a reason to think about other educational options. Every year I know my students will grow and be prepared to go on to higher learning if they choose. Thank you! I appreciate that you added profile pictures to staff communications; I would encourage CCA to keep finding ways to make CCA an institution that recognizes young students need to nurture their social skills with their peers and teachers. Thank you for an amazing experience.","Make your curriculum engaging for students. Students should be able to interact properly with other students and there should be more opportunities for students to go outside and interact with their peers in CCA. Sometimes the cyber part of it all can get too much and balance between interaction and the cyber world is key for students.","They are doing great thus far","Everything is fine","I can't think of one thing, it seems like CCA has covered  everything concerning the teachers, the lessons and other programs that you offer.","for now their doing just fine.","\nChikdren learn better with friendlier spirited teachers \n\n","Continue to provide help for my child who also has special needs.","I feel that they do all they can to assist my family.","nothing","New pop ups have been seen more often and prevent us from using study island.","N/a","Keep doing what you are doing!","We are presently being served very well.\n","focus on individual needs of each child better.","I wish that there was a way to block the webmailing that the students are doing because it is very distracting throughout the school day.","I don't know","Due to the fact that my children have been with CCA for over three years\nBefore the change over the teachers would call and introduce themselves at the beginning of the school year and this didn't happen this year. \nClosing the Gap\n With that being said it would be a great help if the teachers could call and introduce themselves","The are already great with assisting my children.","reach out to the student more","I'm currently very satisfied","N/A","I truly appericate everything CCA has done for my family this was a good experience for us and we appericate it","Continue to provide my child with an excellent learning experience.","N/A","I think i should get a call back from the principle when i call and leave a message to call.Principals never call back only teachers .NOT good","Cannot think of anything at this time.","Just being there when I need them.","your doing great now","none","none","I never hear from my family service coordinator we have not spoke all year.

It seems they just get a lot of extra work instead of being able to advance.

Sometimes it takes a while to complete a portfolio, and usually there are several at the same time for different subjects. Students can become behind in their work because of this. One other thing is, I know students would attend more live lessons if teaches sent out a quick reminder every day there is a lesson. Although they have calendars, students read emails more often than look at their calendar. Some teachers already do this. It really helps.","talk to me and my child more often.","Na","so far doing fine","nothing right now","No complaints.

The issue is getting my student more motivated to achieve but what CCA has to offer is great.","I was happy that I got the chance to meet my daughter's homeroom/math in person.

I may have a better answer next year.","More hands on math experiences","By lessening the work load to avoid stress. A little stress is a good thing but too much stress can back fire.

Please bring back school recess at the centers.( I do not know why it was taken away. ) How do I know my daughter teachers are effective? What kind of professional development is available to teachers here? Is my daughter on grade level and on track to be ready for college and for a career? How do I know? How will my daughter teacher and I learn how to use the results from the state and district test to help my child make better progress?","not sure\n","I would like to see CCA start having some sports or physical activity team or clubs. where students can complete against each other from all around the state.","N/A","The only two weaknesses in the program are with the technical support and with guidance. I know that this has been a year of adjustment, but initially there was a noticeable difference in the quality of Tech Support. However, that has improved as the school year has progressed. The laptops and headsets still break too often, but because they are promptly replaced, this is only a small nuisance. Regarding guidance, I wish that there was more guidance for our juniors and seniors regarding college and scholarship applications. Other schools direct students towards specific scholarships and hold their hand a lot more through the college application process (SAT/ACT registration, college admissions applications, and scholarship applications). I wish that there was more of that. The guidance counselors are helpful when I reach out to them, but, other than the College Planning or Career Planning courses, there doesn't seem to be a program in place that really addresses the needs of seniors. I think additional support is necessary. I would also LOVE it if CCA would partner with local community colleges throughout the state so that students could participate in a dual enrollment program and get some college credits under their belts while still getting high school credits. I have a few students for whom I am the learning coach who have expressed an interest in attending community college while still attending CCA.","I wish that there were less portfolios in the lessons. I also hope in the future that CCA creates a blended environment where students can be taught in a real class on certain days.","This past year the homeroom teacher has been wonderful with reaching out to me with any concerns I may have had. My daughter spent some time in the hospital and the teachers could not have been more helpful than they were when she got out.  I feel that the teachers she had this year have served us well.","Everything is fine.","The only thing I would like to change is the quizzes should be more questions.","Making the field trips once again open and available for all students, regardless of years attending or ability to pay. The field trips and interacting with the other students was the best part of CCA. The students no longer feel a connections with real people/friends anymore!! This is the major reason why we are considering other options down the road if the current systems stays in place. Not only do the students need the interaction with others students who are doing the same thing, the parents need the social interaction with other parents who know the unique challenges this type of schooling involves.","Its fine how it is","Just keep up with your great work","It's great now","You can better serve my daughter if you have smaller classes and the teacher have a small amount of children to take care of. It is very hard to communicate with teachers who have more than 36 kids to their classroom.","I'm hoping there will be more social interactions among students and also with teachers, even virtually.","Not sure.","They are great 100%","CCA need to cut down on trips restrictions. Family should be able to attend any trip if they are willing to paid for it because for some of us the trips are the only place the kids get to interact with students their own age.","CCA is doing a great job!

My older students are reading the lesson on their own sometimes so the language like it is speaking to a teacher instead of the student does not make sense.","I can't think of anything except replacement of older laptop that has issues.","n/a","1) Do not allow students to delete webmails without learning coach's knowledge.  My daughter calls herself dating.  She deletes the webmails so I do not see them.  I log in as her to see the conversation.  2)  Allow learning coach to determine if assessment feedback can be given at any time of the day or later in the day.  If my son receives a bad grade in the middle of the school day, it sometimes through him off track for the rest of the day.  I would prefer that he would see his grade like after 3 pm.   3)  Cyber school might give some kids the impression that everyone behind the screen is friendly.    Include online safety training with counselors.   Cyber school makes kids too comfortable with the computer and making friends online.  I do not want any students to treat other places like they would CCA believing that all online spaces are safe.","None sure, happy with the service.","Some times it's a little hard to find things on the website.","Beginning of the year info/in person workshop/sessions information available online through text/slides/video.","You have been the best.","Continue to do what your doing.  Offering an alternative  education  experience for kids who otherwise would not thrive in a traditional school.","For our first two years, communication from the special ed department was poor or non-existent. Now that our advocate and I have expressed these concerns and called quarterly IEP/progress meetings, communication has been better. I do appreciate the weekly calls that our learning support teacher has with us. I wish CCA had a better understanding of the unpaid aide work that special ed learning coaches do on a daily basis. Our \"job descriptions\" go beyond the typical LC responsibilities that CCA advertises. Often times we are previewing and chunking lessons, reading lessons aloud, prompting our children throughout their schedule as well as their assignments, checking their understanding, providing behavior and OT support, looking for ways to improve on their deficits, etc. If CCA acknowledged all that its special ed families are doing, the teachers and administrators might have trainings or support hours to coach us on how to help our differently wired children academically. Some school districts provide special ed family support groups and trainings once they recognize the need for additional support. In the meantime, the special ed group on Facebook is helping somewhat with this need for community and support.","If there were Spanish translators that would be awesome.","I've been pleased with the services provided, overall.","I am completely satisfied with my time at CCA that is why my child will be reenrolling.","i am extremely satisfied with cca","I honestly don't have an answer.  I think you guys are on top of everything and when we have had issues in the past it was resolved.  People listen to me and help with the situation.  What more could you ask for?","I really cannot think of anything, except there are some suggestions as far as PE like Braingym.com, gonoodle.com, The lady that is currently on the recorded yoga is very boring, relaxing but boring...","I have no complaints.  I feel like I am always heard when I do have an issue.  Keep up the great work.","Na","Special education educators and administrators need to be current with PA law and IEP policies.

She has a passion for makeup application, helping/ mentoring young children, golfing, cheerleading and dance. Maybe there are more that I haven't located on the site.......","no answer","Reach out to student about transition to college.","CCA is doing great, my children are doing great at school. Excellent teachers!","You have some great teachers and not so great teachers.  I don't know if it is because they have such a large volume of students, but especially this year I have been particularly disappointed with the communication I have had with teachers.  I feel like they do not seek to reach out to students.  I feel like they really don't care about a person's grade.  For instance, my daughter reached out to her Spanish teacher several times during the first semester to try and get extra credit.  The teacher responded with there is no extra credit just redo your portfolio.  The teacher never highlighted the value of the portfolio, never reached out to ask her where she is struggling, or how she could be of assistance?  Mrs. Beuno never went over the fact that there is only one portfolio and it is worth 100%  While the percents are listed, my daughter never experienced this kind of % total.  Most classes it has more of 33% and in the midst of her full schedule and sickness did try to put forth effort, but was also seeking to complete out her semester.  I just feel like the teachers are very impersonal.  While my daughter had a B in the class, obviously by her several attempts to reach out to her teacher, it just seemed like a minimal response with really low effort on the teacher's part.  It would have been extremely helpful if the teacher indicated to the class, hey this portfolio is 100% worth your grade so put a lot of time and effort into this project because it has a lot of pull on your grade level, even more so than the mid term grade.  My daughter studied hard for the mid term, got an A, but it really didn't matter because she missed the emphasis on the portfolio in large part because her teacher really was passive.  I find this to be true of most of the teachers and their interaction with my student.  I am extremely disappointed, dissatisfied and will most likely NOT return.  I have shared this opinion with others because I would like to see greater ownership of the students from the teachers.  I would like to have seen Mrs. Bueno when getting several emails from my daughter to have called my daughter and ask her why she is worried about her grade, how can she help her to get from good to excellent?  My daughter cares and I would like to see the teachers of this program raise the bar for the way that see their students and relate to them.  I reached out to the teachers and was not impressed:(","There seemed to be a lot of change in teachers this year with a couple of my kids.  It got to the point where 2 of my kids did not know who was their math teacher.  Each teacher taught differently and with each change of teacher there was an adjustment period to figure out how the new teacher ran things.  This was very frustrating for both children.\n\nIt would be nice if the middle school science had a book they could follow along with more easily.","Being more clear on materials needed for each week/months science projects etc. Better reading materials that teach them to love classical literature. Spacing of portfolios.","I would love to see the curriculum to be more flexible, more personal and creative. I think that it is excellent that CCA is moving away from the \"Box\" curriculum.  I would love to see the ability for our HS students to attend tech programs along with CCA.  I also think having more portfolio work, community service and real world activities associated with the curriculum would be helpful.  My oldest now in college attended a charter school in RI when we lived there called the Met .. http://www.themethighschool.org/   it was an excellent real world experience for him.  \nWe are very happy with CCA and look forward to the separation from Connections Academy.","CCA is doing a great job already.","Overall, we are satisfied with CCA, however there are a few things that were bothersome this year. Sunday is our family day, as I am sure it is for most families. It is the only day we do not have school or work. We frequently get communications from CCA on Sundays. Since everyone gets email on their phone now, it is disturbing to get those school related emails on Sunday. It always interrupts family dinner or something fun we are trying to do together and puts a damper on things. Personally, I do not think there should be any CCA communications on the weekends unless it is an emergency. Also, I understand the need for the use of filters to monitor the integrity of the students work, but twice this year my daughter was accused of cheating when she actually did no such thing. She sits with a parent or learning coach at all times and there is no way it happened. Both time she was very upset and wanted to leave CCA. She felt the teachers were accusing her of lying and cheating, which she really took to heart. Perhaps the teachers should be a little more sure about these accusations before communicating to the student. I know these are 2 things that may not seem to be major concerns, but they are enough to change the way we feel about the program.","We are extremely pleased with how CCA serves us currently and cant think of anything that would need to be better.","Please, Please, Please! Do not schedule the portfolios all at once from each subject, this makes the curriculum overwhelming and exasperating for the students and the parents especially when they have more than one student enrolled. The portfolios are not hard, there are just too many too complete at one time. There is also not enough time given to complete these portfolios.","not sure","nothing","respond more quickly to emails","By continuing working with the parent/learning coaches and keeping the communication lines open.","You all have been doing a great job I really appreciate all the help you've been giving my son and my family I think this is going to be a long-term relationship thank you very much.","For children who need modifications, like my son, make these options easier to find and use. My son often forgets to use them, mainly because he does not see them. He regularly completes work that is too difficult for him and his grades reflect this.","more mandatory due dates for tests in the main subjects (and pop up reminders of those due dates) My son gets overdue because puts off taking test.  An app on his phone allows him to set up things to do for the day and insert the times that he is to do them.  at those times a notification pops up and tells him 'you should now be working on ...' and that has been very helpful.  something like that might be helpful for younger kids (middle school age) if it was thru connexus.","na","Like I had said everyone has been amazing and more than helpful. I would never give a bad review because of one person. I think everything is perfect. Thank you","It would be great to have a few more elective options at the high school level.","They do a great job, I think next year we will be more involved in extracurriculars.","This has been a great experience and we are greatful to have had options for our struggling student.","Keep up the good work!","No complaints","Nothing comes to mind at this moment.","It would be nice if there was an 8th grade graduation, like at every school in our area so that my child and the children of CCA could experience that closure and end of such a huge milestone. It would be helpful to provide us with materials, videos, documents and materials to help friends and family understand this schooling. Car magnets, tshirts, sweatshirts - we would love to display our pride for our school but there is no where to purchase or do these things!","I really think it would be helpful if CCA had more live lessons for elementary students. Two live lessons a day seems subpar compared to the amazing schedule that the middle school has. There is a lot of critical learning that happens in elementary and too much of it relies on a learning coach. I am not a teacher, and Science, and Social Studies are all in my hands. It is too much to do without a live lesson for these subjects. It also feels like when middle school comes for my current 4th grader she will be overwhelmed with going from two to MANY live lessons. There needs to be a transition here. \nI wish CCA would talk up their high school and promote it to current 7th and 8th graders instead of leaving parents in the dark about what to expect, forcing us to find the answers on Facebook message boards. Many families in brick and mortar are ushered into high school in a much more welcoming, open manner, and it is just not the case here. CCA has the curriculum to back it up, I think if you focused on your 7th and 8th grade students and parents and talked about staying through to highschool and what your high school has to offer, it would not only be appreciated, it would be beneficial to you as well.\nIt saddens me that there is no stepping up ceremony for 8th grade students. 8th grade is a big deal, and there is NOTHING done at CCA to congratulate them, honor them or get them excited for high school. There should be as every brick and mortar in the area does this for their 8th graders. \nThese are issues that MANY parents feel. We will be continuing at CCA but I do wish that existing families were ushered through the changes, such as elementary into middle school, middle school into high school a bit better. There is a lack of human contact here and this is the only time when it feels like we are NOT in a \"real\" school. If these issues were addressed, I feel as though CCA would thrive. Thanks for your time!","The new class schedule was more difficult than helpful.  My son did better with a set schedule and not so many options.","I think there should be better instruction on portfolios on the message board. Language Art class don't have any instructions on the message board. I've been in and out o f the hospital this year so my daughter has fallen behind at times. I think all classes should have instructions on the message board because student may do homework in the evening do to family situation.","Get the special ed part some decent staff.  My LST has called us once in two months.  I had to ask for a month for a norep for the new IEP, but in the end it didn't matter.  NONE of the changes have been implemented since December. I have called, emailed,  begged for help.  Now I am forced to start due process.  I do not believe it's because no one cares.  But you can't ask LST's to facilitate the IEP's, sit in all those meetings, AND work with the skills with the kids.  There isn't enough staff.  Your curriculum has nothing in place to serve kids with ADHD, yet how many kids would benefit from having lessons modified for them?  The special ed department could stop putting out fires and actually start helping the kids.  Have been fighting for help for my kid for three years now, and I am no further along from when I started.  Three. Years.","You don't serve your families anymore. Field trips no longer work with kids in multiple grades. new teachers are forcing things like skills tutors for straight A students or assigning permanent 0's without warning when formerly, we'd have a couple of weeks, your special department should be sued for their blatant disregard of the law.  You got overwhelmed by your size and don't appear to be fixing it, just advertising for more students.  It's a slap in the face.  I withdrew two last fall, and my last child this week.  Done.  IT's a shame because when we first enrolled 4 years ago, CCA was top notch.  Now it's just a brick/mortar school online.... kids are a number, not real people.","Keep providing great teachers and curriculum!","Common core needs to go.  This curriculum is terrible but I do love the fact that CCA teachers can help learning coaches and students navigate around the common core curriculum failings.  Also the class trip policy needs to accommodate the fact that families have more than one student enrolled and has to choose between their children when going on a paid trip.  I was also disappointed in how the replacement of my 4th graders teacher was handled.  Serious lack of communication on the administration's part.","Need better ways to manage my children's access to webmail.","CCA has served me well!","Can't think of anything at the moment.  Unless you want to send an actual teacher here to teach her one on one :D","CCA did fairly well this year. I think what was offered was good.","Just keep up the existing great service.  Thanks.","i guess just call ppl back and we are still getting used to it..\n","I think CCA was a good fit for my daughter and all of the teachers were so supportive of her committment to ballet training.  My only qualm was with the graduation project.  From my understanding, the graduation requirement is mandated by PA.  My daughter successfully completed her graduation project in 10th grade at North Penn.  She completed it early so that she didn't have to worry about it later.  However, when she switched to cca her graduation project no longer counted and now she was required to complete a 2nd graduation project.","N/A","I don't have any suggestions.\n","Perhaps a few more classes devoted to the medical/healthcare field.","So far everything is ok","No suggestions at this time.","I don't have any suggestions.","More synch classes for younger children.","Let semester b open early for the kids that can handle it. My kids were done with semester A 3 weeks early. I knew we were going away in February  , so it would have been nice to get ahead in semester b. Also I do not believe in busy work so opening semester B up early would have been great! At the end of school year for those done early create a club to do experiments. I took my kids on many self created fieldtrips to the zoo and ect...","I would love to have live lessons five days a week again. It really helps with having multiple kids.","It would be great if the student planner be more flexible, so I can move and schedule the day for my child right on the planner calendar.","Unsure - I'm happy.","I wished my son could have more friends, so maybe a place where high school students could meet up a couple days a week to do lessons.  The field trips are nice but not enough students my son's age attend.","Get rid of he assessment emails, I have 3 children so it clogs up my email it sometimes hinders me from getting to the urgent emails. I see the feedbacks in the grade book the emails are to too much. Also, I struggle with the \"I can do it myself' child, and then when faced with failure is ashamed to ask for help. Another issue is Guidance for seniors that are failing that are not their teachers that could call with encouraging words would be nice, when they get a call from their teacher they are not thinking help their thinking this is my teacher, I spoke to guidance once this year to change a class for my daughter at the beginning of the school year and come the find out the teacher had no record of her and it was pain and my daughter never spoke up until it was to late. It has its plusses and its minuses but so much better than going to a school that determines what they will and will not do for you because of who you are. CCA has opened doors no matter your struggles. thank you.","idk","They already help me.","Great teachers, great curriculum, great school.!","My daughter wants to go to Vo-Tech and was hoping she could go thru CCA","Unsure.","It would be nice if CCA had one on one tutoring especially with math.","explain the process on experiments and portfolios better","By remaining the Best online school, and continue to help future students as you have done so, with my daughter.","They do a great job.","all is good. No changes.","nothing I can think of","More timely communication between teachers and parents.","There are certain courses and materials in the course that I feel are too much for some of my students.  I wish I had the option for those non core courses to choose what to do within them.  I.E. Ed. Tech, Art, etc","Provide structure and consistency for special ed kids. My son's English teacher refuses to provide structure because according to her that's just not how she teaches. Teachers are constantly out for other projects so there's either no class or class with a teacher my son doesn't know. This sets off my aspergers son and apparently there is no alternative for him. This makes our home life hell at times and the teachers hands are tied. There needs to be more consideration for special needs kids.","The new High School Live Lesson offerings are not the best for some families ours included.  My students prefer daily LL's that follow the course planner that are offered by the same teachers at the same time on a schedule.  My high schooler gave up trying to keep track of when LL's were being offered, what they were covering, etc.  He simply watched the recordings as he needs too and works with the individual teachers.  Another big let down this year, was finding out that there was no printable course catalog available.  We can only access it online.  It is very hard to help my student pick courses for next year when we can not have it readily available in our hands and have to keep flipping between screens on the computer.  We used to mark pages, highlight, etc....we do not have that option this year.  In 11 years of being here, I would have to say that this was probably the most disappointing.","By fully developing your own curriculum and stopping the ridiculous payments to Connections Education. You waste precious taxpayer dollars! Fix it now!!","improve some of the curriculum- art is really not appropriate- some of the science curriculum treats the children like college students who need to read the book and understand- had it not been for the teacher and the gifted program my daughter would have lost interest in the science curriculum-","Curriculum for some of the subjects needs to be reviewed and adjusted. The arts curriculum is too advanced and sometimes not even appropriate for a 4th grader.","Opt out of PSSA testing. Waste of educational time. I believe CCA has more tests in an average year to show what my children know.","Thank you for the past 4 years.  CCA has been a great option for us.  We appreciated Dr. Flurie's video updates-short, informative and relational!","n/a","No PSSA testing!!!!   No Keystones!!!","CCA could serve us better by having all staff follow though on what they say they will do and not leave us guessing last minute if medical accomodations will be followed.","better response from teachers on some subject","N/A","stay flexible","do not know","it was great","Not sure","A lot of assignments (HS) tend to be unnecessary and over-kill (English assignments).  The foreign language is very good, except they tend to spend too much time on the culture, etc. than the basics of vocabulary, grammar and speaking it (Time to Talk is very good, should probably be longer or more frequent).  Study Island assignments should only be given when extra help is needed (more busy work).  Career planning also tends to give too many assignments.  I agree the children should think about it, but the detail involved in crazy; most kids (and adults) don't know what they will actually like or want to do for  a living.","I would be nice if the teachers could teach along with the course work. It is hard for a student to spend an hour on a live lesson and then have another hour or two that they need to spend doing the actual course.  Do you really want them to be in school from morning to bedtime.  One year that is what my student was faced with.  Teachers should have a timeline to grade work.  We still had work that had to be graded right before the progress reports were printed and therefore you never got to read the feedback since it was past the marking period.  In Language Arts we are telling our kids to read books like From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler, where they talk about drugs, sucide and kids running away from their parents or how about a Wrinkle In Time where they talk about mediums, evil beings, or confront Christian ideology or what about A Walk With Two Moons when the characters talk about sex and talk about kissing a tree pretending it's their girlfriend/boyfriend. What happened to the classic books? The curriculum needs to be looked at again. In science a lot of the lab do not work out.  But when you complained about it 3.5 years ago with your first student and it comes around again for your next student you know nobody is listening. My biggest complaint is that as a parent I am always doing school.  I feel like I have no life.  Either in the day I am helping kids with schoolwork or at night grading their papers. There is no rest on weekends either when the kids are making up for anything they did not complete throughout the week. At times I feel like the course and verbiage is too difficult. For example the way the Arts lesson's instruct Kindergarten, etc. kids.  They don't understand it because they have not seen those words.  I wish also that we were allowed a few scheduled field trips throughout the year.  One year a teacher told me she would only approve 4 hours for the field trip, although it took me 1 hour and 20 minutes to get there and come back. Then after that we still had to rush home and do school when we got back. My child was working until bedtime. Also, a long weekend for Spring Break is too short.  You can't even go that far for such a short weekend.  Needless to say that most spring breaks we have to spend doing school work. I also wish that some of the subjects used books like 6th grade science. The fact of the matter is that if this curriculum wasn't free I would probably have picked another one a long time ago because there is no balance between life and school, since we always seem to be doing school and even when there is down time we are working on PE which is the same as doing school.","No comment at this time, we are extremely happy with CCA.","At this time my biggest problem with CCA remains with the Special Education Department.  Official deadlines are rarely met, services are delayed being set up, and communication is often lacking.  Improvement of this department on all grade levels would make CCA much better, quite possibly the best Cyber School in Pennsylvania.  The Cyber School model in Special Education could vigorously meet the needs of students, especially in the lower grades and there is a good chance that many students could progress to minimal to no IEP accommodations.  Happy parents, lower costs, and an excellent selling tool.","Revamp your curriculum.  You have a lot of forms provided in the lessons that are not useable. There are lots of errors and contradictions in the curriculum and also the answer key has incorrect answers at times which is difficult for the learning coach.  Each teacher has there own way of doing things.  Some teachers do not go by the rubric in the lesson, but have their own rubric.  If you do not attend the live lesson, since they are optional, then you do not know what is going on and you will get points off. Points are taken off on assignment even though they are not on the rubric. Some lessons are too long.","Let the student know when they are not doing something right","Na","Continued support for Learning coaches.  Advice, encouragement, helpful tips...in small bits.  Not another long lesson for us to watch.   It's hard, especial with multiple young kids enrolled.  I'm hoping to be able to request teachers.  That's been a tough one.  Having a teacher who takes the time to connect and get to know the student is important.  Not all teachers are great at that.  I need someone else who will help me if I see a struggle or problem.  If they only talk to my student for 30 seconds a call and cancel most Live Lessons, that won't happen.","We are fine so far.","The teachers need to be a bit better informed about allowing kids to move ahead. We had no issues with my daughter (now in 6th) moving at her own pace when she was in K-2 but with my son for math we were told nothing could be done (policies had changed) until I heard through the FB group that I should talk with the principal. Once we did that we were able to have my son move forward. His teacher was not aware we could do this (or did not want this done) thought she has been very supportive otherwise.",null,"In our case CCA was exactly what we needed to get our daughter through High School. We started in 10th grade and our experience was very positive. I did partner with a tutor to aid me as my daughter's learning coach, which was not required. We were quite pleased with the curriculum and the fact that she was accepted into 3 universities (the honors program in 1) is a testament to its strength.","The teachers haven't quite been as responsive the past 2 years as they have been in other years. It has been hard to get a hold of teachers and have them return phone calls/webmails.","N/A","Teachers need to not penalize students for not attending Live Lessons when they are carrying a straight A average. Teachers need to have a set time to grade items, there have been multiple times this year and last that my students have waiting over 3 to 4 weeks for a quiz, test, or portfolio to be graded, this has held them back on moving forward in a positive way. If teachers are not holding and recording and posting their Live Lessons on a regular basis, they need to be penalized. Again, this has effected my students in a HUGE way!","really very satisfied","At this time, CCA has met all our needs!  Thank you to all the staff for their dedication and willingness to help the students succeed in life.  THANK YOU!","n/a","More understanding when it comes to child missing school because of doctor appointments.  The learning support teacher needs to help and pay more attention, it seems he really does not care.  The one my child had last year was wonderful, you can tell she cared and really tried to help my child, the one my child has this year is severely lacking.","Continue to train teachers to be active and listening supportive team players.  Andrea Azzalina and Ann Breithaupt are excellent examples of what teachers should exemplify. Unfortunately, we have experienced less than stellar quality in the past.","Not sure","Find your exemplary teacher in each grade and have them train their grade colleagues.\nBring back Hershey trip - even if it means cutting out others throughout the year. It really helped Cca feel closer when we did that","Would love to see more grade specific gatherings at the school centers. It would not involve a cost of a field trip, just the chance for the kids to maybe work on a portfolio or discuss what is going on in their classes, etc.","We enrolled toward the end of the school year- at the cut off point to be exact. This made navigating the site much more challenging- almost to the point of frustration. More detailed information on how to navigate lessons would have been helpful. I would have taken a class. It makes me sad my child can't join a club until after 30 days of enrollment.","One thing I have noticed on Field trips or at the centers - the teachers do not interact to much with the students face to face. One in the center, they did not seem to have control of the students. Would also love to see the science teachers have \"hands on\" labs in the centers and for those who cannot attend to see them over live lesson.","I don't have any complaints.","More direction as to how to access material with lessons for enrolled student.  When I tried to access learning material it says access denied, use courseconnect and not able to find this material in order to help my student.","previously mentioned these","We enrolled in the middle of the year which made it a little difficult to get caught up but the teachers have all been patient and supportive to us and our son. The orientation evening was informative and helpful.","Everything is fine at this point.","We just feel that our son is doing whatever, we have no input, and the teachers don't call the student until the last week of school. Having the students do their projects at the end of the semester with no penalty is crazy, that's not the real world.","I think you are doing a great job. I wish you offered a magic pill that would motivate my teens some days. :-)  I really like that you have classes for learning coaches as I have learned some helpful tips from them. Unfortunately I can never attend the live lesson because I work but I am glad for the recordings.","We did enjoy the Hersheypark experience.  We wish that could be brought back.","We would prefer live lessons every day if possible, but understand if the teachers need this time for activity days because we also enjoy attending these special events as well.",null,"I think we are already served well! I can't think of anything that would be better.","I believe a schedule should be put out on a monthly (or other type) basis where teachers let parents know when they'd like to call. My work schedule is rather crazy and 9 times out of 10 I miss the calls because I'm working.","Provide more field trips and social events closer to my location.","The equipment had a lot of technical issues.","Unsure.","We generally have had awesome teachers.  We have a Physical Science teacher this year in the High School who doesn't answer my son's emails, ignores class questions (even when there are only 3 students present), and is not keeping up on grading within a realistic time frame.  He even stopped recording during a class to tell the students that he's going through a really tough divorce!!!  These really sub par teachers need to be removed.  There are so few of them, which I'm very thankful for, but they do hurt the school and the students.","Nothing as of now","Just hold your teacher's to a reasonable reason/grading schedule for assignments.

More Art/PE teachers for Middle School.  The amount of students in each live lesson doesn't allow children to participate, causes major chaos on the chat pod, and sometimes causes issues with entering a live lesson...too many kids to just one teacher....not as effective as it could be.  Leap Tests and Benchmarks should be alternated, or NOT overlapped like they are.  Educational Technology Course is very repetitive year after year.","We are very happy.","If the program was more flexible, reliable server connections that didn't mess with our home internet, and better written curriculum in various subjects.","The curriculum is AWFUL!  It drives me batty that my children study the book, study guides, &amp; past lessons and the knowledge that they have on the unit they've studied is not tested upon, in many Unit Tests.  Instead they are instructed to read long stories and answer 5 questions about the story they have never heard before.   I will NEVER understand why 3 Science Books are provided to Middle School Students EVERY YEAR but NEVER referenced and do not go along properly with the online lessons.  And those LA \"What/Why do you think...\" questions on the test make me really angry, as I don't think any answer should be marked off incorrectly when you are asking a student what they think, but I do feel that the student should have a chance to explain why they think their choice is the correct one; and then be graded on that portion of their answer.  Once again, I am holding on hope that the curriculum for CCA will improve this upcoming year.","you guys were good.  My child won't be returning next year.","I cannot think of anything.","This is our fourth year with CCA, and we are very satisfied.  The few suggestions we have are as follows:  1) eliminate the non-contact approaching alarm and alarm for students with straight A grades, or consider replacing it with an optional Webmail contact, 2) get away from the federally-controlled Common Core curriculum, and allow the creativity and vision of CCA's administrators and teachers to drive the curriculum, and 3) try to more carefully develop schedules and planners, so that multiple portfolios in different classes are not all due around the same time.","My concern with enrolling her for her 11th and 12th grade years are the lack of hands-on labs in the science courses.  We're also interested in dual enrollment which is not offered through CCA","Only down side is the labs in science classes.  Not as hands-on as I'd like especially in biology and chemistry.  I know there are AP classes but dual credit offerings would be helpful too.","better more understanding curriculum","Meet the teacher days ... re evaluate your field trip system . each kid should be able to pick a trip that the whole family can go on. not just 1  a month. bring back the Hershey trip","I would like to see a better option for families with multiple grade children close together be able to combine their Social Studies and Science classes, keeping LA and Math on each child's grade level.","Your doing well.","Unknown","My only concern with the science classes is that they are not as hands on as a brick and mortar school.  I realize it's hard with the geographic area that you cover and having a \"lab\" would be very hard.  That was our only disappointment with science.","I think Special Education could be more responsive to concerns and questions. I also feel like information for parents could be a little easier to retrieve.","My son has learning support classes and we are hoping it will return to the style of his 1st year at CCA where we could have the choice to attend the LL or do the recording other than being required to attend LL which tends to lessen the flexibility of cyber school. This was a nice option on his \"off days\".","My son moves up to 6th grade middle school and he is concerned his teachers will not be sweet and kind like Ms Kelsey McGovern has been these last 3 years. So making his transition into middle school a little smoother may help him and our family greatly. Thank you for all the hard work done by all the staff at CCA","There needs to be fewer modifications with the lessons.  My son prefers to work straight through.  Adding modifications and different places to turn in work creates confusion for him causing lower grades.","Provide more field trip opportunities in my area...As it stands, there are VERY few in Berks County.","i think it is a good school doesn't need to get better.","CCA is serving my family well.","At this point there is not a better way of serving our family. I have already decided that my daughter will attend a different Cyber school next year.","Some of the portfolios could use a example of what the finished product that the student is required to do looks like. Some of the portfolios written instructions are  in my opinion vague and confusing.","Have more activities in my area.  Ex: picture taking, parent programs, graduation ceremony\nMany activities take place in Harrisburg or Phila which both are at least a 2 hr drive and many activities are for half a day.  I would like to attend activities.\n\n","They have been very helpful. I'm not sure how else they can serve me better.","I'm satisfied with the service.","None","I would like to see teachers teach our children to take good notes. To show them how to take notes and not just tell them.","Just some observations . . . Sometimes the tests are really long and my student loses steam till the end. I'm not a fan of the timed tests, although I believe my student doesn't have any this year. Perhaps they're already gone. And the really big one . . . I would much prefer that once the student hits math that needs a graphing calculator, they are issued a school calculator like a TI-84 plus. I appreciate the ease of the online calculator, but the student cannot take that into the SAT or ACT tests. Plus if the students are issued a calculator, they all have the same one and the teacher can really help them become familiar with it and get the best use out of it.","We have been very pleased with CCA!","Better support/compatibility with Apple devices.","With having 4 children enrolled emails were difficult to separate as to what student it was for.","While still working as a school is doing, everything is fine. Children should always have the cameras running laptops for teachers to see children and correct any task. This way it's like my children in just one year they learned to read in English. The class is much more interesting and more serious.","No comments","I was unhappy with the fact most of the materials my children received were damaged. The other cyber school my child was in gave us everything we would need for the lessons but cca expects me to purchase most of our own materials.","CCA is doing a wonderful job.\nVery happy with my child's progress.\n","The only thing we have to say is some of the curriculum other then we love the program","The curriculum is choppy in that it can be hard to navigate the lessons. I feel it could be set up better.  The only thing I am not very happy with is the quality of the curriculum. I feel better could be chosen.","I am satisfied with our experience at CCA","Make sure that the kids have at least one home financial course.  Our kids need to know how to handle their households.","cant really think of anything.","Non.","Unsure","I had a laptop to be sent in the beginning of the school year.  It sat in the warehouse for two weeks before it was actually sent out on the truck.  I was sent a new laptop but it failed, so I sent it back and received an older one.  But the older pc had no webcam in it.  We used the older pc for about 2 months and decided to use the webcam for class.   But there was no webcam.  I had to call Tech support and they said that model had no webcam in it.  They should have sent a webcam with it in the first place.  But they did send a webcam for it after I called about it.  I have had no problems with the older pc.  That's really the only problems I ran into with the school.  Everything else is fine.","I may choose to have my daughter return another time at a later time.  I think the teachers are great but the curriculum seems to move really fast, especially in 3rd grade math. The amount of topics they covered is mind boggling and my daughter had a very hard time keeping up. We had to look for outside pages for her to do to help her with the concepts. I think it would be better to teach ideas a little slower and get them more secure before moving on. I don't like the fact that there are no science and social studies classes for the younger grades. Also, I feel the higher grades need to have more consistency.  They need a math and english class every day not once or twice a week. Also, there should never be an overlap of basic classes.  My son,  2 different years had to pick which class to attend because there was an overlap of basic math, english and science.","The adminastration could be alot more understanding of children with special needs!!!!!!","CCA can better serve parents with children in the Special Education Program with better communication.","Perhaps have more variety of classes to choose from.","unsure","There is a lack of communication within the structure of CCA. This is not the fault of the teachers or the individual employees but shows a disconnect in how information is accessed within the organization. If this cannot be fixed, it may be easier for parents if you provide a single point of contact for issues.","I think when a student takes a modified test, that there be a check mark they can check to be able to move onto another lesson. We had this problem over spring break, where it wouldn't let him move on because with modified testing, we must wait until the teacher grades it. We did however go into the regular test and he answered one question, submitted it, clicked the check mark so the system knew he took the test and  had to send his teacher a webmail explaining why we had to do that. He started late in the semester so we were trying to get him caught up.","N/A","better communication between teachers.   we just had a grade given of 0 for an assignment  that was given by one teacher and graded by a second.  i had to go and give the grading teacher all of the emailed information  about the assignment so my student could get a passing grade.  now i just got an email from that same teacher giving  a 3 paragraph warning that he had better study harder because he only got 26 out of 28 points on a chapter test.

Come to the special ed table as a true team looking for the childs best interests, not as a battle field waiting to see who gets shot first.","lose this curriculum.  I have found some teachers prefer to work outside the curriculum at the high school level.  I have had issues that were escalated to school principals with emails sent to my kids and were not satisfied as I was told they would be.  It is not appropriate for the teachers to push political views as was done in a 7th grade social studies live lesson.  Unproven and DISproven information is in the books with regards to social studies and american history.","na","We had so many problems starting up this semester that my daughter started out almost 2 months behind. While the faculty is extremely helpful and caring, the staff are confused and not helpful.","Perhaps by making mid year transfers less discouraging by being so many lessons behind.  I'm not sure how that can be avoided though.","I hope that CCA can continue to offer flexibility to the students who chose a cyber school because of activities during the day. Some teachers are flexible and work with our schedule, others not so much. It is difficult if teachers' have due dates for assignments/portfolios that are completely inflexible. My daughter is very studious and conscientious but cannot participate in \"live\" lessons when they occur during the day. She is in a gymnastics camp in Texas every 6-8 weeks, with little internet connectivity, which makes it difficult to complete some assignments. When we had difficulty with a 9th grade English teacher, the principal was very responsive although the teacher was not when we contacted her.","Better field trip program and end of year field trip.","By offering more choices of high school electives.","Everything has been great.","Just keep on doing the things you are currently doing. You can't please everybody but we are one happy family for having joined CCA. Thank you for an amazing year in which my son has thrived in a learning environment that suited him very well indeed. Many, many thanks!","I am very satisfied with CCA.","Completely satisfied as is, our family that you for all the support.","No response - I think the only challenge I have is the alarm status for my high school student.  She chooses to watch the live lessons on her own time as needed so her teacher involvement is minimal and she is always falling into alarm status. I find this frustrating when she is on top of things - if she needs help she reaches out: if she doesn't need help she keeps moving ahead.","by making some of the lessons a little easier for students with an IEP. Also by not having portfolios due but rather more lessons easier to complete .","Eliminate common core material!!","1.Well, we can start by getting rid of TRICK/Confusing questions on quiz/tests.  And or having more than one correct answer only allowing to choose 1 and the child gets it wrong.(Obviously the opinion of test maker).\n2. If a child is doing well in say Math, I believe that the xtra enrichment class(Skills tutor) should NOT be taking points of a child grade IF that child is an/a Distinguished Honor roll student.  Children should maybe Not be required to reach a certain amount of time that will reflect Regular Math grade.(i do believe these enrichment classes are a plus tho). \n3. Trying to find a way that children CANNOT go take assessments without a LC consent. If that means a LC must put in Passcode for them...sounds good to me. Or sign in under LC name...also sounds good.  I have had times when i walk out of room and child goes to assessment and clicks away to see if they can just getter done. I'm not likin that .  \nI appreciate alll CCA does for us.

Have in-home tutors available in every district.","Allow families to participate in field trips when space is available and they are willing to pay. It has been disappointing this year that there are field trips with space available and because we already attended a paid field trip cannot attend even if the family is willing to pay. Limiting the ability of child to get socialization and additional experiences.","Just continue to help students that need help or tutoring.","I am quite satisfied with CCA's services.","My child is special needs and has a lot of therapy and drs.

And let the families have the opportunity to go to more field trips by giving them so much per student per year and let them use it how they wish there are months when we are not interested in field trips and months when there is more than one. So it would be nice to use the money as we would like on the trips we would like.","More socialization in our community. That is really lacking in our area.","Everything is fine.","It would be helpful to have discounts in place in your area to have them participate in lessons-music,  art,  etc.  Also discounts to staples out office supply stores to help with the cost of school supplies.

Thank you for your time.","I would like to see more field trips and the end of the year picnic to be brought back this is sometimes the only opportunity for the students to meet their teachers.","From my experience being new, I think teachers need to realize that we may not understand the program fully. My son received a 0 for participation in a Math skill set. We did not have it and also didn't understand that we had to do it or where to find it. We reached out to the teacher and she never responded back. After 3 weeks of not seeing anything on it, she gave my son the 0. She never communicated with us about it. We are new and I feel that she should have realized that and reached out to us. In short, new people need a little more follow-up communication.","I have no issuse","Open a branch office in the Easton/Bethlehem/Allentown area. There are a lot of families that would benefit from access to teachers and CCA event.   We have rent hotel rooms constantly.

No substitute teacher is provided. In lower grades teacher only teaches LA and Math leaving 3 or 4 other subjects to be taught by the parent. I did not sign up to homeschool my children. I would expect a cyber public school, who is taking tax dollars from my local school district,  to educate my child in all subjects and teach every lesson as teachers do in my local school district. Also to have someone there teaching everyday, whether it be the teacher or a substitute teacher.","At the moment everything has been great.","You say you are a public school and receive the tax dollars that would normally go to my school district. I find that incorrect because I am constantly having to teach subjects that are not covered by a teacher. One child is in 4th grade and out of all the subjects he has, he is only taught Math and Language Arts by a 'real' teacher forcing the parent or what you like to call a 'learning coach' to teach the rest of the subjects.","I can't think of anything more than you are already doing.","By adding a newer ciriculum.","Will answer after she begins","Have to say my only issue is my 11th grade teachers not taking time to get back to me.  My 6th graders teachers are awesome.","CCA is doing a great job and I would not change a thing.","I would like more support on math and language arts for kid.

They are a great school.","Honestly, there is nothing CCA could do better. My husband and I researched schools all over the state, and in some cases other states, and we were constantly disappointed in the other schools. Prior to CCA, we looked and toured several private schools and again were highly disappointed. We are not only very satisfied with CCA but also relieved that our children are getting the best education while remaining safe and away from the bully issues of brick and mortar schools.","Give more options as far as testing and portfolios in all grade levels.  Two of my daughter's teachers offered a \"path 2\" option this year.  All her tests, quizzes, and portfolios were dropped;  however, she had to complete a project at the end of each unit.  She usually chooses to make a power point presentation summarizing everything from each lesson.  I feel that she has learned so much more by doing this than taking the tests and doing the portfolios. She does spend more time working on these projects than she would on the portfolios and studying for test; however, the amount of learning is definitely worth it.  I wish this was an option at every level.","I am completely satisfied with CCA.","CCA is an amazing school, but guidance does take awhile to get back in touch with graduating seniors. Also some sport teams would be nice.","I do not like how many \"portfolios\" there are.  I don't think that all of these projects are as good of a learning experience as other choices for learning.  Some of the classes seemed rather  boring.  I have homeschooled my children and have found so much exciting learning material out there -  I just think there are better, more exciting learning opportunities that can be incorporated without so many projects that do not allow you to move forward until you have completed the project.","I have really appreciated my family mentor. She has been so helpful with navigating and understanding the information available to me as a parent/coach. The only issue I have is that my husband and I both work full-time so it makes attending many of the social events difficult. We are heavily involved in youth programs at church, so my daughter has plenty of \"socialization\". But I feel like she may be missing out on some things simply because I cannot get the time off to take her. She falls behind in some of her projects too because of me as well. I am wondering if maybe there would be a way for students with working parents to have \"assistant coaches?\" or maybe there is a resource that I don't yet know about?","I have been very satisfied with CCA.    If it continues to operate the same manner, I would be happy","CCA does a excellent job as is.....  The only one thing I would suggest is having the children spend a little time with their teachers in person. Maybe like once a month have the teachers and students meet at the school so that they can all interact and take some pictures for their school year book! I love home schooling my son. But he does get sad when he sees his friends and they have year books and all their friends signed it! It would be really nice if CCA could do that. My son has been with CCA since 4th grade. He still talks about his teacher \"Miss Miller\" He always wanted to meet her, but he never did.   :(    He's in 7th grade now.... Mr. Hooks class. He met him on picture day. He was so nice! He came out to meet with Lukacs and I. He took a picture with Luke and it made his day! He told me mom.... How will all my teachers know that they helped me and that I appreciate them? I told him that he can always e-mail them. But when he reaches his goals in life that, that will be validating and rewarding on it's own!","Can't think of anything...","In person meet and greet with course teachers at the beginning of the year.-My 10th grader\nHave some live lessons to just meet people in classes.-6th grader","CCA has met our every need.","I think CCA is doing a bang up job.","I am fully satisfied with CCA","For elementary school, I would like to see live lessons available for science and social studies at least once or twice a week.

I believe the interaction with the teacher and their creative lessons will help my student understand the material.  \"Mom is boring.\"","teachers do not always respond to webmail....I have reached out to most, but some did not respond......guidance counselor has been great.....","As of right now I feel CCA is doing a fantastic job!","More field trips in the north east area! You can make students be host in their own livelesson so they can teach their friends or even chat with them so they don't feel so lonely.","I would like to see a little more variety in electives for high school.","I would like to see live lessons offered one or two days a weeks for elementary science, social studies, technology class and art.  My kids do not work independently, so without a live lesson, they rely on me to read through the lessons.  It's difficult for me having more than one child in the program to give them the help they need.  Also, as a busy mom, I have household chores to fit into my daily schedule.","I'm not sure, I think the only thing that confuses me is the attendance schedule. I'm not sure how to mark days that the school is closed, Maybe you already have that somewhere and I just don't know where to find it?","I know there are procedures to be followed when asking for certain help, but sometimes it is the red tape that turns parents off to coming to ask for help. Maybe make it a little easier for children to get the help they need without it being such a bothersome and long process (asked for an IEP meeting at the end of the last school year, and am only now finally getting an evaluation - and that's still predicated on receiving the PTE).","I'm honestly unsure if they can very satisfied","I truly don't know of any way to make me happier with my daughters schooling CCA is definitely for us!!!!!!!",null,"I can't think of anything CCA can do better at this time. My children have been very successful and doing very well.","There are too many portfolios, especially in the second half of the school year.  I know that my son could be learning more about the material and doing a better job, but knowing that he has three other portfolios due on top of all of the regular lessons each day is too much for a kid.  He doesn't even feel like he has time for live lessons lately, which doesn't help his grades.  Have one place for portfolio directions.  Some directions are in the kids' lessons, some are in the learning coaches' lessons, and others are sent in e-mail.  Very confusing.  More local groups and activities would be nice.  A local science fair, maybe having the chess club get together and play in person.","There are no complaints because all that was expected and more are being offered from this school.","I would like access to things like Skills Tutor over the summer so my kids can continue math practice. Also, find a way to give ongoing feedback about teachers/field trips/etcs. Change the field trip policy - one paid per month is too limiting. I would be happy to pay for additional field trips.","Start live lessons immediately at the beginning of the school year (there is currently a 1-2 week gap). Reduce the impact that PSSA's have on the student (teacher miss live lessons, reduced field trips during PSSA's, etc.). Start live lessons for social studies and science earlier than 5th grade. Provide enrichment for students based on iReady scores. Be able to provide feedback on each teacher and each subject at least twice per year. Keep Learning Coaches updated as to the changes occurring within CCA and proposed changes for the following school year. Allow more than 1 paid field trip per month. Do not have grade level and STEM field trips count as the 1 paid field trip per month (or allow more than 1 paid field trip per month). Have more clubs that meet in person  once per month - like robotics club and Odyssey of the Mind. All grade levels should have a grade-level field trip each year.","I love everything about it, if my kid likes it I like it.","Have more LL for more classes than just LA and Math.","have more LL classes for more subjects\n","I do not have any concerns at this time.","seems great so far still getting the hang of it that's me not child","cant think of anything right now, everyone has been fantastic so far","Teach the middle school teachers to be more supportive and understanding of student needs.  There is a HUGE difference between the attitude of elem and middle school staff.  I understand the kids are needing to be more independent but there is no need for rudeness or calling them lazy.   Also upgrade computer systems, we have been having issue when submitting tests and quizzes answer are not being shown as entered when they are.  This needs to be fixed and addressed.  Since all assignments are online this is a huge hassle trying to get lessons reset.","satisfied with CCA","Happy with CCA","We really don't like temporary zeros.  I feel it's not a motivational tool.  It is discouraging for the student not to be able to see his or her true grade.","More field trips closer to our area. Most are to far for me to travel to.","Have middle school teachers and administration respond to emails and complaints better.  Would really appreciate if teachers would keep their political views to themselves and not force there views and lies onto the students.   They are hired to teach a subject.  When teaching history teach history.  Do not compare the current president to a dictator that gassed and murdered millions of people.  When he has done no such thing.  Teachers need to keep their religious views to themselves as well.  If you are going to teach about religion teach about ALL of them.","seams good wouldn't change","More tutoring","We would like to see more local field trips.","So far everything has been great and I can't think of anything.","We work well independently and would prefer fewer portfolio items.  So much time is spent (as a learning coach) scanning and sending paperwork.  I will have 3 children in CCA next year.  Portfolio items are going to be overwhelming!!!!!","Adding more field trips in our area.","The only downfall I seen is the live lessons sometimes change or they email you the day of them at different times sometimes an hr before the lesson, and if you have already checked your email  you dont know there is one or it changed. The live lessons should be set for the same time and day all the time. I think that would help from them missing any","Add some additional classes, like Creative Writing, to further help my child get ahead before starting college.

I do however want to add, that maybe make sure the teachers don't penalize the kids, for missing the live lessons.

That is just an opinion, definitely isn't a complaint. thank you","Like I said, for the most part I like the teachers, but there are a few that are rude and talk inappropriately to the children. Also, better computers, they are always malfunctioning.","CCA has done a wonderful job serving my son and myself for the two years that he was enrolled.  I am sad to have to leave, but one never knows if we may return in the future.","keep up the great work of the teachers and services you supply.","I have no suggestions. I love everything the way it is. I love that it has been changed to no Live Lessons on Wednesday. That gives us a catch up day. My children attend every Live lesson. I feel they are extremely important. I love how the students can interact with each other.","Improve special education teachers.","Look into less portfolios.","I am not sure. I think you do a pretty good job. I am not a fan of common core, but realize that you are offering public education. I also hate the teaching to test, but again realize that is forced on you by the state mandates.","Because we have multiple students in CCA, we find that the portfolios become overwhelming especially if they fall one right on top of the other. Right now my 5th grader will have 2 portfolio for L.A. just about back-to-back. I am trying to do extra review for state testing with her, but we are finding that all of the portfolios (for all my students) are so time-consuming that we have little spare time to test prep or even other activities some days. Thanks:)","Eliminate some of the portfolios. They have gotten to be way too numerous in the past few years. Also enforce consistency among teachers \"making their own rules\". There have been many teachers this year that have tried to tell us live lessons are mandatory or that you won't get credit for certain assignments unless you attend a live lesson.

I feel that since my child has been asked to speak and record herself speaking the foreign language she is learning that she is getting a better and more fulfilling learning experience. I would recommend that you keep that and expand  upon that concept.","unsure","Everything's good","Better trips. Only complaint is the trips have been undesirable or canceled.","I have recently had an issue with the Guidance Counselor not responding to questions regarding course selection which bothered me a bit.  I am sure they are busy, but these are important questions, and I feel kind of ignored in that area.  Perhaps CCA needs to hire more counselors so they are not overloaded with students and can be more effective at \"counseling\".","I'm happy with the services that CCA provides.I guess the only thing that I would like to see is the ability for children to do a work-study program for at least one semester. I think it's important for kids to experience real life before graduation so that they can pick a direction based upon knowledge and not just dreams.","I know that there is a specific curriculum you must follow but I would like more flexibility. Such as, a 4th grader obviously knows how to write at this point. Having to hand-write everything is tedious to them and they become less enthused to do it. I believe they should be able to type their papers and such as this is the way things are done in the majority of life. I would also like to see live lessons for science and social studies. The amount of reading they must do and absorb is difficult. I think that hearing the information will help them understand better.","would like to see more field trips closer than a 2 hour drive","Nothing at this time.","I dont know. I dont feel like the elementary program is very good. my children are rushed through 20 stories and not given enough time to really understand the spelling and grammer stuff. I always feel like there is a deadline looming. there is too much rushing. trying to fit more then is needed, quantity is not quality in this case. as for my 8th grader and 9th grader. again rushing through topics not really exploring anything.  I wish I could say otherwise but we have been considering leaving to traditionally home school for sometime now. I have been with cca for 10 years. I dont want to leave but I havent been feeling like the education is quality anymore. I want my children to love learning not view it as a chore to be finished as fast a possible. they are always fighting some deadline.","Make sure my son graduates before he ages out","CCA has done a great job with serving my children","things are going pretty good right now","Nothing that I can think of.  This year has been our best year yet.  Happy with everything.  \nThe only thing that has just been slightly disheartening, is that for each of my daughters, have had their K year interrupted by teachers having babies.  It feels a bit more isolated when you do not have the teacher that you came into the school year with.  This is nothing that is the fault of the school but thought I would just mention it seems to happen a lot and can be a bit difficult.","Change the frequency of the approaching alarm status on their home page. It is extremely inconvenient and annoying. My students turn assignments in on time  and get good grades. They may seldom attend live lessons, but because of their grades and discipline in keeping up with assignments, this doesn't concern me. In cases like this, they really don't need teacher contact more than once a month. With approaching alarm, we end up having to interrupt what we are doing to contact a teacher every 2 weeks.","I cannot think of anything that I would change.","There's nothing specific that comes to mind, but we would like to know if there is a chance that there will be an end of year, Hershey Park Trip.","The only thing that we missed was the year end celebration. We are extremely satisfied with the integrity that the school possesses.","More support from teacher, better communication with teacher, more willingness to seek out alternative curriculum when what is currently being used isn't working.","I think everything is good! I'd love to hear more about Box Tops, and the Hershey Park trip! It's amazing to finally meet the people that have been teaching out children all year!","Don't allow the stress from the unclear and uncertainty of life deter you from the purpose of CCA. If you find yourself becoming like the others than that's a clear indication that you are going the wrong way and make a U-turn. Continue to be different by proving us with innovative, project based curriculums. Continue to allow and support differences in learning, build on strength and not weakness. Provide etiquette class for all children along with social skills training. Make learning a thirst needing to be quenched. Find the tools to inspire even when inspiration seems unattainable.","satisfied","CCA is doing an awesome job and I am completely satisfied in our 5th year with CCA.","Once the budget is settled, I'd love to see more field trips and maybe they Hershey Park trip to come back.","I feel there needs to be better communication between teachers and students. Sometimes it takes days to hear back if my student has reached out.  The teachers never seem to keep tabs on how my student is doing and if he is falling behind or inquire what they might do to help, UNTIL I as a parent make a phone call.  Some of the teachers do not cover the same material in class as the students are expected to learn in the online lessons... After a while my student feels like this is just a big waste of time as there is so much to cover in online work.  It is even worse if the teacher wants the students to discuss topics for a whole class- as if they are really teaching anything. \n\nI think it would be beneficial if the classes met more than one or maybe two times a week.  How is a student in Spanish 3 suppose to learn  conversational language this way? In the higher level math classes twice a week is barely enough either. My other children were enrolled in a different cyber school and their classes met more frequently and I believe it worked better for the students.  \n\nSome of the elective classes are almost entirely self taught.  What is up with that?  My kid could learn the material online without being enrolled in cyber school.\n\nAnd while we have had some very good, engaged teachers while at CCA, I would say we have had more that were not.  Sad to say, but true. \n","More activities","I don't have any problems","I can't think of any way that CCA can better serve us.","More communication regarding the support and process through guidance for college",null,"I can't think of anythng.

As of this year, we had experienced great difficulty in courses that required great independence.  This has not worked well for us as in all other years at CCA he was in a much more fitted course.  Also there are no electives that my child with intellectual disability could take yet we were asked to pick 2.  As well as in the intent to return we had to pick courses that will obviously not work for us as there were only options for general education.  This will impede on the beginning of the year when he is put in general education waiting for special education courses even though he has been a returning student for the last four years.  This should not be a difficult task each year to get started in the school year.","I would like for the teachers to communicate with the parent and student more often.  I would like to see the work set up in a more clear and organized way.  you have the daily planner , but it doesn't always coincide with what the teacher wants done.

It is nice to put a name to a face (I do like the pictures of the teachers on the emails) \nI am very disappointed with the new way of doing field trips. If it is a monetary issue then being able to spend a certain amt would make more sense. we rarely took advantage of field trips this year (except STEM, which by the way are the best!) Back to field trips. It was way to confusing to decide how we wanted to use our one trip for the month and I certainly never signed up for trips that only cost a few dollars. I believe those trips suffered. If the reason was because people signed up and did not show up then shame on them and make them pay for the next trip they want to go on bu don't make it difficult for the rest of us. Also although I appreciate the loyalty thing I believe that new families should have the same opportunities without having to pay more.","Fix live lesson schedule! Please go back to the way live lessons were done prior to this year! My children all enjoyed attending live lessons and did so frequently or watched recordings. Now they attend about 25% of the time. It is very confusing and teachers do not mark them for attendance regularly so they are often in alarm.  We were extremely satisfied with CCA prior to this year. Teacher follow up has declined also which I find disappointing. My daughters honors science teacher does not even bother to do live lessons.","I think that the lesson structure needs to be re-evaluated to encourage students to read and be able to do projects in advance prior to the dropbox showing up in the lesson. What I have found with the structure is that a paper is assigned at the end of a lesson and the student cannot move ahead without turning in the completed paper. This delays their progress and the students can find themselves falling behind because they cannot complete a subsequent lesson until the prior is submitted. I think this causes the students to rush and not work as completely or as well as they might if they were assigned an essay on a Monday to be handed in on Friday. Then they can complete daily lessons and work on the essays as homework. Cyber schooled kids definitely could use more \"homework\" to get used to having to work outside of the \"classroom\" so to speak. I have learned to work around the system by looking ahead, but I'm not sure other kids have that kind of support from their coaches.","everything is great","Get rid of \"Alarm\" system","I think everyone is doing a great job.

But, high school seems to be struggling. My son has an IEP due to his learning difficulties and health issues. He is struggling with the B part of his math classes, as they have changed the format to a video only assignment. You watch the video or go to the class and no longer have an assignment. He gets lost in his mind during the classes, or the videos and was doing much better with the power point classes and live lessons. Now he is so behind and no one has contacted him or myself after several emails.","Continue on the path CCA is already on. It's been a wonderful 6 years and we look forward to many more before her graduation.","Continue to provide excellent field trips and opportunities for students to interact with fellow students and their teachers.  Plan more field trips at school offices to correspond with the curriculum.","My only complaint about the curriculum is that the Art lessons are much too mature for a fourth grader; the result being that my child resents the art lessons. Too much reading and very little creativity. The unfortunate result has been him wanting nothing to do with art at CCA, while he did not mind art before.","I think everything is great.","Keep doing what you have over the last 7 years. Continue to employ the best teachers in the state and challenge the students with the curriculum. The flexibility CCA offers is wonderful as well.","I wish some of the teachers would respond to emails a little better.","The curriculum is outdated.","n/a",null,"I wish that there was a better gifted or accelerated program.   It is my opinion that the 5th grade curriculum was easier than the 4th grade curriculum.  The curriculum should be getting more difficult to prepare students for Middle School and High School not easier.   My son was often bored this past year.   When looking into the gifted program for him I found that is wasn't more enriching. It was only more busy work.  The gifted math program only skips the student ahead a year in math.  How can you skip a whole year of Math? Math builds on prior knowledge.   These are areas that I think CCA needs to improve upon.    Also, most or the teachers we have had with CCA have been excellent.  They have always exceeded our expectations.  However this year my son's Science/SS teacher left us feeling frustrated.  He did the bare minimum that was required of him.  His live lessons consisted of showing the videos that were already in the lessons.  His reviews were copied from somewhere else and often didn't even coincide with the curriculum.    It seemed like his heart was not in teaching.  I look at a teacher as a service industry.  They are helping to shape our future.  If a teacher is not interested in inspiring and helping stuedents learn then teaching is not the right profession for them in my opinion.","You need to get back to the basics and  work on focusing on educating students. They are our future! Gifted program stinks! You have two teachers who obviously don't get along and this is evident and affects your students. Sadly, we have experience this two years in a row. One teacher is not gifted teacher material. No communication, lack of posting to message board, no information regarding portfolios, LL recording posted 2 weeks late really doesn't help. No control in LL. First 10-15 minutes wasted with nonsense. No encouragement. No feedback on tests or portfolios. Too many mistakes in answer key book and in lessons. Recently, tried to view rubric in 5th grade science only to find a 4th grade rubic on something completely different. iReady testing nightmare. Lack of instruction given for testing and results. Lack of answer key available for SS. If there is a review in the book there should be answers available. No consistency among teachers. CCA is NOT flexible. LL are advertised as 'not mandatory' but are highly frowned upon when not attending,   No reply from teachers or principal. Tech. Support telling us we can skip graded section in lesson instead of fixing problem. Thanks to CCA for my students confidence and love of learning to tank. Don't put teachers in position to teach grades they are not ready to handle. SUPPORT, COMMUNICATE, &amp; EDUCATE! That is how CCA can better serve my student. I have more but I'm sure this has fallen on deaf ears. I am passionate about my students education. I wish CCA was too.","Please help us solve our technical issues?\nWe have experienced \"daily\" technical issues with CCA issued equipment, connectivity, and webmail that has never been resolved. We have had no response to our concerns or what to do about the webmail issues and connectivity issues from our child's principal. Tech support has advised us that our webmail issues are not \"technical\" and will not address them. Our suggestion, based on our technical expert that we hired says the issues are within the CCA environment and the possible solution would be to remove our account and reinstall it -- possibly eliminating the glitches. This suggestion was rejected by tech support as well. It is fair to say that as her learning coach(s) we are very disillusioned by the experience the past 2 years. Its only because our child has progressed that we hang on.\nLastly, we have also noticed an abnormal amount of absences by her support teacher.  Tech issues and teacher absences has caused us \"not\" enroll our child in the summer program offered. We have chosen to avoid the frustration to stay connected technically, and also avoid last minute cancellations or waiting for her teacher to show up for class.","I really don't know since I haven't had any problems so far.","keep doing a great job.

Though I am sure that as she moves forward this may not remain the same and she will appreciate that repetition when learning something harder later on. Maybe a way to test out of that unit if the knowledge is already there?",null,"im not sure","I can't think of anything.","Nothing really","I am very happy with CCA. It was a tough year for my daughter and enrolling in this new environment was very scary. I still am a bit unsure with the software. i try to learn as I go, but I am not completely confident.","Happy with service.","Have information for all children of working age assesable to parents for working papers etc.","There is nothing at this point","The teachers in the 8th grade can give a little more guidance on what is expected on projects and portfolios. My son is struggling to keep up his grades when he is doing work very similar to his brother in 7th grade. The teachers in 7th grade are very good at letting you know what is expected and are more understanding in their grading practices. My son has brain damage and is doing so well keeping up with the 7th grade curriculum. My son without special needs is struggling in 8th grade.","They are amazing.  I have no complaints","I love CCA, but as with anything, improvements can always be made. I feel that the live lessons could be a little longer. Right now, we have 2 live lessons only 1/2 hour each. I feel this does not provide enough time for the amount of children participating in the class nor enough time on the subject being taught. I think some subjects deserve more time spent teaching and reteaching through the live lessons. ( children love to learn off from each other and it helps with the teaching part of a subject ). Also, the field trips provided by CCA are wonderful not only for the educational part but also for the socialization between the parents and children in the school. I would love to see more outings for the parents even if constructed at a local park such as Lackawanna State Park etc. etc. Parents could bring their own snacks and lunches but it would get many of the students a chance to meet others without cost to the school. We have attended the Dickson City office and loved the field trips there as well. The Science field trips really seem to be a hit for all the kids, since the interaction gets them all involved. We are looking forward to another year with CCA. We love our school !","I would love to see Live Lessons available to elementary students in all subjects.","Honestly, I think CCA has been wonderful and the service that is provided is more than adequate.","I would love if Live Lessons were offered to elementary grades for all subjects. I would also like Live Lessons to be mandatory and not optional.","not sure","I don't know","There is a program for public school  teachers to get discounts at places like Staples and all they have to show is I.D. We need a program like that for home schooling families.","The only trouble with CCA that I found was navigating the software. My child found it rather easy, but it took me some time.","I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING I CAN CHANGE, EVERYTHING IS GREAT THE WAY IT IS.","N/A","I am just concerned that my son isn't reading at an 8th grade level. He takes advantage of the video and audio lessons, while going over work with me. My son doesn't do any work independently. I worry he will not pass the Keystone tests by himself. Can he still graduate? He has learning disabilities and requires modifications based on his IEP.","I don't know.","I can't think of anything right now.","Because my child is graduating, CCA can just continue to provide support to my student to help him finish the school year confidently, celebrate graduation, and transition to college life.  (I really have appreciated the timely budget updates to relieve some concern during the school year.  I'm glad that budget problems have not impacted my son's final year of HS and his graduation.)","We are extremely satisfied with CCA.","Be able to provide physical one on one tutoring when requested .","Keep the GT curriculum and provide challenging courses.","My son requires accommodations for various reasons and I would like to have the option of \"face to face\" therapy for some of them.  More activities at the offices would be great too- he would like to have more time with friends through the week.","We would have liked our son to do a duel-enroll program with our local college, but he had to take a full load at CCA which did not allow him to take the courses he wanted at the college.  If the college course would have satisfied the graduation requirements we are not sure why he couldn't take that instead.","I feel as though many of your portfolio rubrics are vague. I often find myself webmailing the teachers to clarify information. I would also rather see more languages offered to younger elementary level classes, like 1st or 2nd grade. My son (2nd grade) attended a homeschool co op this year in order to start learning French. I would have preferred to have him attend CCA. And I really would like to see Latin offered as a class as well. I have been teaching Latin words to my son to help expand his vocabulary. I understand that not all children and/or families would be interested in this, but perhaps it can be offered as an elective??","I'm not sure. I think CCA has done a great job.","I honestly believe it's perfect the way that it is","RespoND to emails faster","Would like to have a weekly list of live lessons that were attended \"live\" as they were happening.","The teachers are changing the tests, portfolios, discussions and most of the time their directions are too complicated and sometimes even confusing. For example the English teacher for one unit had 10 files of instructions on three threads and there was no rubric. Study Island is a place to practice and even read a summary about a topic, the English teacher is grading that too. Benchmarks are just a tool for teachers to plan better to teach students, the English teacher is grading those as well. \nYou need to provide test, and portfolios with clear instructions that are not too long. Also I still don't see any benefit in the \"Discussion\" that was added to your curriculum four years ago. It is a wrong way for the students who never meet each other to judge each other with the comments that have to make for their grades! \nI personally liked the curriculum before you allowed the teachers to set up their confusing and long rules. When parents are the learning coaches to work alongside and in reality more than the teachers with the students, then confusing instructions and time consuming instructions are not a plus for your system. You need to have a solid curriculum and schedule like Connexus.","n/a","I honestly think your Learning Support Dept needs more teachers so that they can give better one on one attention to their students. Kindergarten teachers need to remember that their students are only 5 and 6 and need to let them learn at their own pace and not what the teacher thinks they need to be at. If i knew that Kindergarten was like it is I would have not signed my daughter up this year.","im very satisfied on how they already serve me",null,"Unsure","they meet all my needs already","We are very pleased with how CCA served us this school year.","I really don't have an answer .","Teachers can be more helpful and focused on ensuring my child's education.","they are doing an excellent job! thank you. i can't think of any more my daughter needs. i believe that you get as much as you are willing to take in!","I am very happy with CCA","The teachers could be more understanding of home-life situations and struggles the kids endure with mental health and other factors.","I'm very satisfied with CCA","I feel CCA has served me and my son well enough","I believe CCA does great. I really don't see where they can improve. My daughter should do more herself by doing the live lessons. She just watches them.

I dont see it necessary for web designing and other classes","I think it is an amazing school already, the only thing I would even consider criticizing would be it may need more career electives that would help someone like my son. He has chosen to be a technical educator and has been accepted at a 4yr college. He would have liked to have taken more courses that would have followed that kind of curriculum. Overall it has been a great experience for him and he wishes he had enrolled sooner.","The service is excellent as is. Enrolling in CCA has been a life changer for us.

But if your child is not there yet or forgets to go back through the webmails to find the one that says oh by the way I totally changed up the next lesson and your child turns in what was originally asked. Well let's just say it gets irritating.  And leaves your child confused and frustrated!","I feel CCA serves me so well. I don't have nothing bad to say. One thing that could help is the learning coach have access to teacher message boards. I have to go back and forth through accounts.","unsure\n","No comment as of yet. My daughter just started the program today.","It would be better to not have students attend every live lesson. Messaging teachers should count as keeping in touch. There should be a requirement for teachers to respond within 48 hours.","Don't have elementary live lessons all at the same time.  Have different grade levels at different times.  This made it VERY difficult for me (learning coach) to sit with both my kindergarten and first grade student during live lessons.  I don't know how I'm suppose to pay attention to both and not have both students distracted by each other.  It has been a nightmare this year because of this.  I need to sit with both to see what their learning to help me know what I need to further teach and see what they are not understanding in class.  \nAlso I feel that since homeschooling should be family based, younger siblings (age 3-4)  should be allowed to join in on field trips.  I can understand certain field trips can't accommodated certain ages but I believe most can.  And I think all field trips except socials should accommodated all grade levels if there are other students (siblings) present since they have to be there because obviously they can't stay home by themselves.  You have to remember that in most house holds there's only one learning coach around during the day.  It doesn't make sense to have them sit out when they can be learning something too.  This is why we decided not to go to the 4th and 5th grade field trips.  If all my students could participate then we would of went to both.  Especially since its far from where we live.  \nWe would like to see the science labs (all grade levels) become field trips at the CCA offices to get better learning and hands on experience with the science teachers.  It would also benefit the families since its not easy to afford all the supplies to do these experiments and it would be more fun to do this as a group. \nIt is really important to our family for this school to come up with a music group at the CCA (DC) office.  It would be GREAT to have students learn an instrument or join a choir.  It would be nice to see a small little band or orchestra group perform at the office.","I am very satisfied","I do wish there was a better way to make the kids more accountable  togo to live lesson.","Not sure","Keep up the good job","Revise there policy for high school home school transfers. There is a way to mathematically not include their home school grades into their CCA GPA but present the grades to colleges.","Nothing I love every thing about the school","They are great at what they are doing...No cpmplaints","I have not had any problems yet while being in this school system.","I find there is a lack of communication for new parent regarding how to reach staff and and get answers to questions. Initially I did not understand anything about cyber school, I called multiple times and got voice mail. I even reached out to the president of my sight without response. Very frustrating. I know the parent mentors began calling but that was well into the start of the year. I work full time. I am m daughters learning coach. I voiced concern that I am not at home 40 hrs per week. Unsure this is a good format for full time working moms.","My son is a 5th grade student with a 504 plan.  It has taken this ENTIRE school year for further testing and evaluations to be done (that I showed and expressed concern about LAST year) and we STILL have not finalized his treatment plans (504 adjustments or IEP started) based on the findings.  My biggest concern was him transitioning to middle school without a proper plan in place for him to excel and at this point in time we are into the final marking period for 5th grade and still no resolve. I've done everything on my part (counseling, psychiatrist, medications, evaluations, forms, correspondence) but it seems for every step of the process I've had to chase down someone for the next step or answers.  I'm thinking the focus on your special education department could use some reconfiguring.","So far So good!","At this time, I don't have any requests that aren't being met already.","Offer vo tech to their students","At this time there is not much I would change.  We are currently in our 4th year with CCA and everything is working well for both my children.  If I had to ask for anything more I would ask that teachers in the Middle School level provide a weekly or monthly Lesson plan for the coaches to make sure their students are on track.  Several times this year I have had to contact the teachers to ask \"what lesson should my child be on as of today?\"  Some teachers are already doing this, but others do not.  My daughter has one teacher that she is lucky if she even gets one email a month... and those emails do not consist of any course importance.  SO yes, more communication regarding lesson schedules would be great, especially on Fridays for the coming week or near holiday breaks and so forth.","They are doing a great job","Continue what they are doing, my Daughter in public school was failing almost every class, and would not get help when she asked.","keep up the good work","I am happy. Thank you CCA for listening to me.","Not everything is going good so far.","I can't think of anything. Just keep doing what you are doing!","Some of the lessons need more information for the learning coach along side the student, sometimes we get confused or complete an assignment incorrectly because the students account doesn't have all the information.","they are doing a great job!","Better one on one training for parents. Orientation was in a large group setting with three ppl running it and was not properly prepared.  Was very disappointed that it wasn't more one on one hands on training.","Teach, not teach on how to take the pssa","I would love if there were more challenging curriculum options for my son. He is only in 1st grade, so CCA may offer more challenges naturally as he gets older, but for now we can usually proceed through the lessons without him having any difficulty. There already are some \"extension\" options in Language Arts, so maybe a few lessons considered \"extra challenging\" or the like could be embedded in the regular lesson. Overall, I couldn't be more pleased with this school. It has exceeded my highest expectations.","nothing","Make classes follow a more uniform plan.","I can't think of any way right now.","I'm satisfied with the service.","At times my child is frustrated by the lack of reasonably prompt responses from the teachers.  It is not every teacher, but my child has had teachers that do not respond to email inquiries about assignments or other questions in a prompt manner...sometimes not at all.  There has been similar experiences with a guidance inquiry at one time, too.  So I would suggest that teachers be more available to respond in a timely manner to emails.  Finally, teachers should check assignments and return them in a timely manner.  My child had a teacher last year that complained a lot that she was \"busy\" and had a lot of things going on in her life so assignments, papers, and tests were not graded and returned for weeks.  If a teacher expects a student to complete an assignment by a certain time/date, the teacher should also be as mindful and respectful about returning graded work.  It is frustrating to hear a teacher complain that they are busy...students are busy, too.","I wish Mr. Azzolina was a better communicator, not only with students, but with parents as well. I also wish his message board was created the same way as all the other teachers at CCA. It is hard to get around. I send him webmails and I get ignored.","None.","Help the children learn things that they don't understand that helps us out because we don't know most of what they are learning and it's hard on us and them they need to understand it more better.","N/A","Disappointed in the change of curriculum for pre-algebra.

Multiple times through the school year I had to ask the teachers to run the scheduler to get him back on track with the class. This did cause some bad grades because he was completing assignments ahead of what the teacher was instructing. The staff was very quick to fix things when we noticed the errors. I still have no idea why it was happening.","you are doing a great job..","No suggestions","I would like to see the website restructured to make it easier to find information on the school and teachers. I often find it difficult to find what I'm looking for when navigating the site. Also the scheduler is a complicated thing to maneuver and we often end up running it multiple time to get the desired result.","more trips and activities","Nothing at this time.","Would love to see Social Studies and Science class discussions.

I think those systems could be more user friendly. It would also be helpful if kids had a way to get to know other kids in their classes, like an individual profile about each child with their interests and hobbies, where kids could find out more about the other kids, or an easier way to located kids in their local area.  A lot of the field trips are for all ages, and my child does not do well with younger kids. It would be nice if there were more field trips or socialization opportunities specific to their grade level.","Make the Live lessons be about the current lesson and topic. The student should have one teacher per subject, not a group of teachers...it's too confusing. The school should better inform new parents that their children can still attend activities at their brick and mortar district. School should be having more social activities for the students to meet up, even things that may not be learning related. We love the Adventure Club!!! Wish it could meet more often.","Your doing a great job","YOU CAN'T FIX EXCELLENT THANK YOU.","I am satisfied with everything now.","Be more attentive when considering the curriculum in regards to actual grade level. There also has been numerous wrong answers that were brought to teachers attention within the lessons. CCA should be more understanding, especially when a student starts after the official start date. No child should start his/her new school with added anxiety of 40+ lessons overdue!

I also think that there should be more Portfolio options! The reason being is so the student can choose what they both prefer correlating to the curriculum, and what they enjoy. Also, with CBAs, I think they should be planned; not abrupt calls. Usually the teacher call when the student is busy ((usually in Livelesson)), and you end up rescheduling and playing a game of phone tag. An alternative to this can be the teacher makes a Google Form for the student, send it in a WebMail to the class, and then also record the times that are occupied for other students so it does not create any discrepancies--this would be a little more efficient for the family. Something also with CBAs- sometimes they aren't very connected to the curriculum; but rather just an abrupt assessment for the student. It might be beneficial if they go over an assessment together instead and the teacher decides if they get the credit. For incorrect responses, discuss with them why they are wrong, and reward them with the credit they deserve. After discussing incorrect responses, they also should receive credit. This is for an increased level of efficiency for students and families. Family Mentoring- Personally, I believe that Family Mentoring should be optional. I really find it useless, as I already know all of the information in the phone call... I think newly enrolled families should have the option to be assigned to a family mentor, because really, they likely know all or most the information. There should be like a system where familes can request a mentor. Once assigned, they can reach out and say, \"hey. I am struggling with this. Please help? I am availabale at this time by phone call.\" Quite frankly, in simpler terms, Family Mentoring has been pointless- we already knew about the content in the phone calls. However, my son has LOVED this school so far. He LOVES his teachers and he LOVES the curriculum!! That is all that matters to me. These are just my opinions! :) Thanks for reading.","communication with parents could be better. for new students and parents starting out i feel we were very lost and not sure what to do at first. we didnt really have much help with it all except once my child started and then spoke with the teachers.","I can't think of anything you aren't already doing well","I am completely satisfied with every service available to me through cca.","I really don't have much to say to this.  I think CCA is a great school.  For the most part, they seem to really care.  The only thing I would have to say is I would encourage more training with high school administration and teachers.  In middle school, everyone was so responsive.  It is QUITE the CONTRARY in high school.  It is VERY tough to reach certain people.  I would encourage better training geared towards high school staff on this.  Please.","N/A","I  find that the curriculum can be a little difficult. The math portion of the curriculum does not give my son enough time to learn something new, before jumping on to the next  level of math. It is frustrating.

The only thing I'm not crazy about, and this would be any cyber school, is the lack of social time.  My sons favorite thing to do is play computer games so when he is not on the computer for school he is on the computer for fun.  I don't think this is healthy.  My only reason for possibly going back to a brick and mortar school would be to get him around other students.  Which by the way, he couldn't care less about.

Not all students in the Northeast Region have Learning Coaches home all day to assist them in their educational needs.\nEvaluate the Gifted and Talented Program.  CCA has an exceptional 3rd grade GT teacher, Mrs. Howard who takes the time to make a personal connection with each of her students, finds innovative ways to get her students to think outside the box and engages them on every level to motivate themselves to think beyond the lesson content. In 4th grade, Mrs. Nagle also connects with her students and allows them the flexibility to reach beyond the connexus projects to present a project that they are interested in.  Based on our experience of other GT teachers besides Mrs. Howard and Mrs. Nagle, we are seriously considering not continuing with the GT program next school year for our son.  CCA's GT program needs more teachers like Mrs. Howard and Mrs. Nagle to make the program successful.  It is unfortunate that over the past few years, the program has experienced a decrease in students enrolled in it.  Being in a cyberschool environment gives students the ability to work at their own pace.  With the GT program, it should go beyond that to allow students to focus on what interests them most &amp; push themselves to excel in everything they do. Having a gifted student that can create graphs in power point color blocks to make a bar graph for a project just because that is what the lesson plan says is telling that student that going above &amp; beyond is not necessary.  Or requiring them to handwrite LA drafts when they best brainstorm by typing is unfortunate.  Asking a GT student that gets easily overwhelmed to complete a question on the white board &amp; then not helping him/her when they clearly state that he/she is not sure what to do is embarrassing &amp; deters that student from attending LL's at all.",null,"CCA is doing an excellent job in educating my children.

Sometimes it's hard to work schedules around the mornings.","I am a Registered Dietitian, and one of my current roles is to go out into schools (grades K-12), and teacher nutrition education.   I conduct a 30 minute nutrition lesson and activity for each class, and provide the children with a healthy snack, once per month. There is a pre-planned topic of the month, and is tied into a theme, i.e, February- Heart Month/Valentines' Day, March, National Nutrition Month, etc., so it is such a fun way to learn these life skills. I can't help but think how we might incorporate such a \"class\" as an enrichment into CCA's the curriculum, as the children respond so well. I know providing a snack would not be a possibility in the cyber environment, however, perhaps, a live lesson demonstration of how to make the snack (we send the recipe home with parents, as well), might be nice. We also provide the teacher with a packet of information for the month (newsletter, games, short message of the day, etc., coloring sheets, etc.), so that he/she can continue the same nutrition/wellness topic for the remainder of the month (after I leave), within the classroom. My daughter (3rd grade) loves to bake and cook, so she gets excited when I ask her to help me prepare for these classes, so I'm just passing it along that I think some type of life skills/home economics type class for the younger grades would be a great idea to round out the education received at CCA.

The instruction is more towards college students.  Unless you plan on a career in art related fields, I feel this class can be eliminated.  It is long, boring and everyone has their own opinion of art.  Usually, our answers on the assessments fail because our opinions are not the same as the program.  Sad.

This is completely unacceptable. I feel once this school has gotten so big us families who have been with the school since the beginning are all but forgotten. I have had numerous teachers tell me not to bother them. I do everything myself here because of the lack of support from teachers but when I do not understand something I expect  a little help. I get NONE and are told such by many teachers to do not bother them. There are a very FEW good teachers in this school any more. Some of them act like children with their nasty emails. There are absolutely NO trips in my area for my children. Where there use to be atleast 2 a month. My children no longer take lessons so the $200 a year times 2 children we never get. I have suggested putting it into an account and  letting the children get it toward future education or recently how about purchasing Hershey Park tickets for those families that do not use it. Now we get nothing. No hockey game, no baseball game, no Hershey Park. Every time we get a new coordinator in our area they seem to get a swelled head and have trips only they and their children enjoy.The trips in my area are very babyish for my older children. And CCA promotes families to get together for the change in the trips. Families do not bother with each other and teachers make no effort to bother with families so why should any body even try.  I feel CCA has become way too big for themselves and teachers now have too many children in their class rooms just like the B and M schools. It has become more like a business than a family school. We stay with it because we are use to the way the school is on the computer and as I said I do everything here my self, which is fine my children are learning, but when you get these new teachers that come in and want to be big boss and change what we have been doing all these years it does not work. We soooo miss the school we once loved. The teachers we once had who cared, called and got to know. School is a serious thing for children to learn, it is the law and the teachers I have been dealt in the past 3 to 4 years and especially most recent DO NOT CARE.  I  had to change my daughters math teacher at the beginning of the year she called and made my daughter cry so bad. I will not have that. Or an Algebra teacher who told us he didnt want to be bothered helping my son. We went from December 8th to the end of April 2 years ago with out any help while my sons Algebra piled up. Called and called and called just about every day and this is how long he went? Emails go unopened or simply unanswered even from principles and guidance counselors. I did not go to school for this but I am doing the best I can here for my children to succeed. I do not mind no help but can not stand when we send in something wrong and a teacher  sends a nasty email of such who didnt want to help us in the first place. WE MISS OUR OLD CCA.","I am just beginning so I am good so far","I believe everything is great so far\n","it already serves me well","Actually check on what the teachers are doing with their time.  One teacher never corrects work on time, ie; write a rough draft.  Finish the remaining classes, get to the final draft and still have o input on the rough draft.  Really.  Very disappointing.  Also, care about the family.  I had an issue.  I contacted the homeroom teacher.  No response.  I emailed the assistant principle, no response.  I emailed the homeroom teacher again and became  very terse in my message.  My response was that he thought that he responded  It is aggravating.","CCA has done a wonderful job serving me and my family.

I think the students over think these projects and it's easy for them to get behind.  I think that when they get behind they feel overwhelmed and do not learn as they should because of worrying about getting these portfolios completed.","give us info for the summer session","Train teachers to cover the material in the actual lesson. STOP the breakout rooms, they are a waste of time. Stop the portfolios, they are more about frustration then actual learning. Stop teachers from calling during other live lessons, ask them to respect that.

We would like to see more gatherings per grade at CCA facilities to maybe give the children more chances to get to know one another.","I would like to see the old curriculum back or at least an option other than common core. If it can't be avoided then I feel like children who can do things like math without the longer common core way should NOT be scored lower because they solve problems the traditional way.

Sometimes kids are confused or not sure how to do something and they don't get started and then get behind. they are afraid to contact the teacher so the teacher needs to contact them.  I liked when the teacher get then started or even help the kids complete there portfolios.  That is where they get stuck the most.  The portfolios is sometimes very time consuming and confusing. The kids needs more help on getting started on them.  I think if you had the kids interact more like math they would maybe catch on better.  They go to live lessons but until they work a problem out they don't quite understand sometime.  I think they need to do more on the board when it comes to math.  They need something that is fun in math that helps them keep up on there addition, subtraction, and multiplying.","Sometimes I feel that there is too much work for the kids when it comes to the portfolios.

But at 11th grade I feel he is not prepared for college in that he doesn't meet project deadlines.  When I was in college and high school. If something isn't handed in on time, you got a ZERO - F.  I feel my son pushes the limits on deadlines though he is a very good student, I fear when he gets into college he may just flunk out because he's not been 'trained' to meet deadlines on assignments.  I tell him in the workplace that could easily get you fired.  I think it would have helped starting in 9 -10th grade it would have helped if CCA teachers were more strict in that aspect. If started now - his gpa would be effected and that would make a difference in his college choices at this point.  And end of Jr year the applications with the jr grades go out.  So it's no help now. Personally will have to make this a goal for his sr year.","I would like to see a music class offered. I also would like to have less educational online courses. These can be overwhelming at times.

We frequently find mistakes in his lessons (including the math answer key book, which is so bad we've stopped using it entirely), and the Gifted and Talented courses should actually test for giftedness so they aren't bogged down by students who clearly don't belong there. French should be available as a foreign language for elementary school. Japanese would also be a course of interest, and more electives in general.","There aren't enough elective classes available at the middle school level. Our son has already completed Spanish 1 and 2 and is interested in French, but it isn't available until high school. Also, there should be a Music elective available. Prior to this school year, Music was available and our son loved it. We are disappointed that there aren't more electives to choose from.","WE NEED MORE ELECTIVES! Middle school electives are slim and our son has done most of them in his first year of middle school. There won't be any left for next year.

We seemed to be kept out of the loop and weren't sure what was happening.  Everything is resolved now and the teachers are great but that situation caused a little confusion for a week or two.  It would have been better to have the school administration, principal or homeroom teacher notify the parents and students so we knew why there were emails to that teacher not being returned and lessons not happening but not being cancelled either during that week or two of math.

My oldest is not good at math, to say the least.  He struggles with it, and as such I had to work with him a lot to do his math, and I would say he had a low C high D the year before CCA.  Needless to say, CCA's math is different in several ways than the math we were doing, and all of my children struggles with this adjustment.  My oldest really struggled and failed his first semester of math.  Consequently, they changed the P that I had given him in math to a F.  I understand their reasoning for this, I do not agree.  There has to be another way to handle this sort of situation.  I was very upset.  This went on his transcript and effected his GPA, when I never failed him.  To say he had an F was a lie.  I also felt it was disrespectful of the work we had done prior to CCA.  I asked to just have it taken off, since he was going to have to take that math again, but they couldn't.  I did not fail him.  I am fine that he had a hard time adjusting to the new way they do math, and since he is really not good at math, he just didn't survive the transition and failed.  I am fine that they wanted him to re-do the math he had done with me.  I figured it could only help.  I just felt really insulted that they decided to change my P to an F.  He passed that math with me. \n","Help me understand what I need to know to help my son. Computer wise I'm not sure how to do some things. I feel lost sometimes.","More one on one to get my child focused and learning.  When he asks a question to some of the teachers they rush through only giving him a few minutes.

They are easy to not do because there is so much other work that needs to be done-and on the computer a misspelled word shows up in red and can be easily fixed with spell check (making it easier for the kids...they don't have to look it up in the dictionary).  It is very important that the children learn how to spell. We would like to see more accountability for the spelling words.  Additionally, I would like to see a handwriting book available at the kindergarten and 5th grade (cursive) levels.  (Note: There is one available for 5th grade, but it is on-line.

There have been a few things that we will be looking at for next year in order to decide if we will continue to remain at CCA.

I also reached out for dyslexia review and OT help for my daughter in November, it is now March and although we have had our OT evaluation and notification that Alexia should be having OT weekly, there is nothing set up and there has been no communication at all from CCA.

It would be great to have bigger lessons due less often so we could be away from the internet.","Get rid of the Algebra needed to graduate not all people will need Algebra in their future work!","Have no problems!","I wish there was someone to offer more support with PSAT registration, I only received one webmail, and I missed it because my mom was very ill from cancer.

I t,hink some more notes, a step by step email on the math, or even some more visual emails that woould work for her.","I would like to be able to send webmail to the teachers directly from me on my homepage but the teachers are not listed on my homepage.","I am truly satisfied","Improving instructions for portfolios. \nThere are rarely any school sanctioned field trips in our area.","n/a","We are very isolated here in northern PA. The Williamsport office seems not to offer as many face-to-face opportunities as other places. Field trips are so far away that they are not practical.  Also, often the headings for different lessons vary from what the headings are in the book or in the learning coach's book. It can be very difficult to figure out where you are when they are not coded the same.","Over all I think that CCA serves my family and I very well. The teachers all worked well with me when my work hours changed. I would like to say all the staff does such a great job.","I feel everyone does such a great job already.","i think cca  is doin a great job.","My child has an IEP, all teachers obey the IEP, but some go above and beyond to help my student learn. Ex. Some teachers will allow my child to hand in things that are late, which really helps in my childs situation, and some don't. I wish they would all do the latter and put school about learning the material not just finishing it on a schedule and not letting students do the late work.","There is so much available that it's rather overwhelming at times.  I'd like to know more about utilizing classes that are geared toward my student's interests.  Both boys are very athletic.  Golf, body-building, gymnastics, and rock climbing for a few examples.  What classes would be useful, such as sports management, etc?  Who do I go to for information in guiding their future toward their likes?  The career planning has been somewhat helpful.  They both know exactly what they want, but not sure how to make it a career.  They know their strengths and are both very confident in goal setting.","I wish that CCA could do away with Common Core, though I do know that is not an option.  I really have no complaints.   CCA has been wonderful for us.   I tend to work really long/unusual hours and CCA allows us to work around that.","Some of the lessons (Science) if you use the on-line version of the book you cannot move the side bar down to read the entire page/or have the screen reader read it.   I would also like to see more Tim and Moby videos since my daughter responses well to those.   Because some in our home work \"overnight or late\" scheduled phone calls would be nice like we had in the lower grades instead of random ones.  It makes planning the day much easier and that way we could make sure we're home when the call is to come in.","The classes are very hard for my son. The only person in cca who has kept touch and tried to help over the last 2 years is April Trego. I want to shoutout to her for caring about my son and I as we are going through difficult times. Sam is an iep and has struggled with depression. April is really the only reason I don't completely homeschool. Like traditional schools it seems iep students are left behind. Lucky though my son being in this type of school isn't very affected.","Not sure, I haven't had issues that I didn't speak up about and have handled by CCA very quickly.","CCA overall serves my family well, but I would like to see more seminars and events geared towards college preparation and the college application process.","My son has felt that this yr has been extremely difficult. Although it's nice to have several options for LL( class room time) , having different teachers teach then grade the work is hard. He hates it! Some teachers are just better then others. Also, teachers seem over loaded with amt of students and don't return emails or phone calls back in a timely manner.( last yr his math teacher was MIA most of the yr and even after leaving phone messages and emails wouldn't return calls for weeks! This is MATH! It's hard and I expected her to be available! And his grades showed her careless attitude! )Seems like every yr he has multi of teachers leaving for maternity leave in the middle of the yr. I understand that they need their time off BUT it is extreme disruptive to his learning to be switch back and forth between teachers.  The lack if consistency is  one of the reasons we have not decided on CCA for next yr yet. The other is the amt of unnecessary work that is required and the difficulty of the  curriculum  that makes me want to pull him out and put him into reg public school.  When we started 4 yr ago, there was definitely more involvement between teacher/students.  Most all his teachers he has never talk to on the phone.  His homeroom teacher has been amazing this yr. We are so thankful for him.","We are coming to the end of our 6th year with CCA.  The only thing we did not care for this year is the abundance of teachers and availability of classes to attend.  I understand it was supposed to be beneficial to those who could not attend a scheduled class.  (This is why I love CCA so much though.)  Even though it gave more flexibility to students, it was, at first, somewhat confusing instead of helpful.","I feel that it shouldn't be my child's responsibility to contact teachers or they will go into alarm.  Yes, I think that teacher contact is important, but that the teachers should be calling them, not the other way around.  Unless of course, if the child has a question or needs help then the child should call the teacher.","No issues","I can't think of anything at this time.","overall we are very pleased. The IEP we carried over was not really necessary and not sure were even using it?  It did cause a delay in registering and no one from that department ever made contact with us after at least 5 phone calls.  We ended up going thru the school counselor who helped a lot.   I'm just bringing this up so I hope other families don't run into the same situation.",null,"Disappointing field trip program the last two years.\nWhere are the art and music opportunities?\nOur city has a symphonies, art museums, art and music academies.\nWhat we get offered are trips behind the scenes at Pizza Hut?\nWe have been locked out if 90 percent of the field trips we have tried to attend.\n\nSecond. It would be very effective to facilitate meetings with groups of kids who live close to one another.  A small group class/ activity/ field trip.","We have two very minor complaints, one was that he was not challenged enough in math this year, which is probably a function of him and not a broader issue.  He liked the class and the teacher, but was a bit bored.  The other was more of a structural issue of any online or home learning environment, and that is a lack of daily direct social interactions, which we feel our son needs.  So how can you help here?  I would say in math, have some extra credit and more difficult projects that are optional would be one simple one.  In social, hard to say; you have the field trips, but beyond that I don't know.","Everything is great","I would like to see more AP science programs (Biology, Chemistry, Physics &amp; Maths) for the high school students as right now I don't see much options for my child in the future.","keep up the great job :)","This is our first year with CCA. I do not have any suggestions on how to better serve the students and parents. So far, the staff, including administrators, teachers, support staff and event field trip coordinators have provided excellent service to our family.","I think CCA could improve by updating text books and answer keys to the parents. There were many times while working in the Mathematics text book we could not match up the pages, pages were missing or the online slide courses did not match the learning coaches book. We did submit this information to teachers and were help however, this can be frustrating and could make a parent and student feel they are missing out on their education.","I'm not sure of that answer due to the fact that I'm highly satisfied with CCA.","Perhaps, CCA could take another look at it's new filed trip policy. Last year, my kinesthetic learner and I attended over 30 trips and were thrilled, but this year we are limited to choose only free trips and one paid trip. If given the option to attend more trips, we would not mind paying at all. Our many field trip posts on facebook last year actually provided CCA with a few new students. We do not attend CCA for the trips, but they really do add to my son's experience and social education. Please consider a change?

I understand that teachers have a lot of work/students, but I feel like she needs to be challenged more academically.

The slide indicator for each of the areas questioned, didn't work with my computer, but only let me choose \"5.\"  Why? I have no idea.  CCA's biggest liability is its own website and computer technology.  I've spent countless hours working through tech issues. Add to that, teachers don't use the site as intended. For example, the \"planner\" that you're supposed to update, but teachers tell you to ignore it and read all their emails instead to know where they are in the curriculum. Then there's the volumes of mindless emails that you have to read through. It's like being spammed daily about every little detail of school life for K-12th. Then the lesson titles don't always match the grade book titles, which makes it difficult in tracking grades in lessons.  Then there's the filter software that doesn't work with everything CCA has.

In the past, they have been a very important part of socialization for my daughter.  We would have done more of the free ones like PE days just for the socialization, but there weren't that many available.  Also, many of the field trips didn't fill up, but we couldn't even pay to go to them ourselves, and then some end up being cancelled because of lack of interest.

Their teachers have Livelessons for Language Arts and Math but nothing for Science and Social Studies.  I feel that in 2nd and 3rd grade, the test become very intense and cover a lot of information.   I don't know how to prepare them for their tests because I don't know what to expect in the tests.  I feel that breaking it up more and not covering so much in the unit tests would be better.  Because so much is covered it might be beneficial for the teachers to do a review lesson at the end of units.  I know the teachers have a lot on their plates and they do wonderfully.  I just feel this is an area that I am not fully prepared to train the students for success.","CCA can better serve our needs by having their teachers available later in the day. My daughter works during the day and does her schooling later in the evening. Sometimes it could be around 7pm and she would need some help from her teachers. But since most of them are only available until 3, she may not get the answers she needs.","Teacher communication this year has been the worst we have experienced in our 5 years at CCA.  We have had 1 phone call from our L.A. and 1 call from homeroom/science teacher since Nov.  Considering that my son has an IEP and we haven't heard from his learning support teacher is a MAJOR concern!  Overall, we love CCA.  But, if this was our first year, it would've probably been the last year because of communication.","Better, more timely, communication with some teachers would be greatly helpful.","I have recommended multiple people to CCA.  One fallout however has been that as they search for CCA, they are confused by the new signage and actually enroll in the Connections Education program.  Though I was happy with the experience as Connections, I feel they are missing out on some nice opportunities due to the the confusion over the name chage this past year.  I know that with time this will not be an issue, but it is for now.\n\nI like the variety of field trips that are offered.  However on the classes side, I would like to see an option for instrumental(band)/music/choral, that would allow students to get together, in a classroom setting, not online.  Although online is great, there are some things that make the experience much better when it is direct and hands on.  A weekly, biweekly, or monthly program to join students, with the goal of a final performance.  This gives them something to strive for as they practice, alone and together.",null,"I, personally, am a techno dinosaur! Thank you for making the parent portal easy!

The overall attitude of teachers and staff has changed.  At one time everyone was excited and enthusiastic,not so much anymore.  I have one student who I feel is not being challenged with daily subjects.  She is a fast learner and hearing a lesson once she understands the concept.  Her Kindergarten teacher said she was advanced and she said she would be very surprised if she didn't start 2nd grade curriculum in 1st grade.  The following 2 years of first and 2nd grade the teachers had little or no suggestions as to how to challenge her more, instead basically said be glad she is at or above grade level.  So I question myself as to where she could be or what she could have learned in those 2 years if she was challenged or even advanced a grade.  So overall designing a course of study for each student(like advertised) did not happen for my child.\n\nMy second area of concern is Field Trips.  I think it is a huge disadvantage to the students to have these regional field trip employees planning events for a huge area.  When we started the Family Mentor planned local and really simple trips that were meant to be social for the students.  I agree adding more educational aspects is a good idea however the main purpose or need for field trips is social experiences.  Some of our favorite trips were local ones at a pizzeria and farmers markets.  In these types of trips the students learned about community and how different people and businesses make up a community which in my opinion is as important as any educational trip that is offered now.  Another huge issue with field trips is in my county and our neighboring county there were 0 field trips the entire year.  Huge disappointment for my children and myself.","Nothing","Its perfect how it is.","Not sure","Helping my student.","provide better math books","not sure","The service is sufficient","The only complaint we have is with the equipment given to the students.

I'm not sure I'd know who to contact if there were issues regarding his 504....","Nothing, thank you.","CCA does very well, continue to provide quality teachers and curriculum.","While CCA uses field trips as a selling point, I found that one area lacking.  Since we are only able to choose one paid field trip per month, it forced us to choose between two really good options.  We would have happily paid full price for a second or even third field trip.  I live in the south central region, and the better field trips were usually an hour or more away.  On the other hand, Thelma Mayo and Brittany Sheffer are terrific ladies to work with.","CCA has been an excellent choice for our family. Just keep doing what you are doing.","I find everything to be great. The only drawback is the once a month paid field trips. We have three grade level trips back to back to back and have to choose one. I personally would be willing to pay if that was an option.","If you want them to send items to the teachers than why not just send it to them in webmail","Making the setup in the beginning of the school year easy like easy transition of learning coaches .would like to see more quick communication between the parent or leaning coach and the new year setup team clearing doubts if any .Working more efficiently with people who are trying to set up cyber support programs in their local areas.","We have been very happy with CCA, and as an OT who provides services to students from other cyber charter schools- I am SOOOO HAPPY to be here at CCA!!  So much better than the rest! Keep following your mission, you know what you're doing! :)","With this being our last year, all I'd like to say is that we are very grateful for being able to have CCA as an option to traditional schooling! My son has been with CCA since 7th grade and we've had a wonderful experience. I intended to send him back to our local public school for high school, but he liked CCA so much that he begged to continue it through high school. There have been a few teachers we weren't thrilled with (which would be in any school setting), but overall, we've had the BEST teachers and BEST experience! I thank you for all the hard work the teachers put into their jobs -- I know it can be quite challenging with some of the students/parents that do not put efforts into their work. My son is more than thrilled to be graduating and loves that he got to do his schooling from the comfort of his own home. THANK YOU!!!!!","n/a","n/a response","More interaction between teacher and learning coach. More awareness of different types of family setup/learning coaches.","I have always gotten all information and needs taken care of. I can not think of anything they need to do better.","At the moment, I feel like everything is working well.","Not really sure at this point.  We are at an impass right now, and not really sure what we can do to improve our son's situation.  He left a very bad situation at his private school, so we enrolled him at CCA with all good faith that this would be so much better than prior schooling experiences.  However, he isn't getting caught up in his work and not seeing any light at the end of the tunnel right now.",null,"none","Just keep doing what you're doing!","Unsure at this point","Better curriculum would be a huge plus. Fewer portfolios would be great. Certain teachers need to be better monitored as we've had issues with not enough live lessons or live lessons that are frequently cancelled in a high level, tough course. That's not acceptable to me. Certain teachers in the high school seem like they're on their own with little to no oversight. These same teachers also take quite some time before grading assignments.","The following are the \"weaknesses\" of CCA\n*The Spanish Curriculum is based to strongly on culture and not enough on learning the language.\n*The curriculum moves to fast in Science and Math.  It does not give the students enough time to totally grasp the material before they are moving on to the next lesson or unit.  (Some teachers have adjusted the curriculum which have really appreciated.)\n*In high school, Live Lessons should be taught more frequently for Science as it is for Math and Language Arts.  Science is challenging in high school and deserve to have further explanation from your stellar faculty.  I realize (from my son) that many students complain about the length or frequency of Live Lessons but these kids only have one shot at high school and deserve to have the best chance at understanding these concepts that we can give them.\n*The last thing I think could be improved upon is it sometimes feels that students are being \"taught to test\" rather than taught to learn.  I notice this in the curriculum not the Live Lessons or teachers.  It is a weakness of the curriculum.  It seems disjointed or material is missing to give a more complete understanding of the lesson.","We used to love CCA, however, the last couple of school years, the school has taken a steep decline in support and services.  All 4 of our children have been enrolled in CCA, one has graduated, one has dropped out, and the two youngest just aren't receiving the support they need as they both have IEP's.","I have a 3rd and 4th grader, a lot of times they are learning the same thing in Language Arts or Science, just on a different level and at a different time (meaning the units don't line up).  I wish there was a way, I could teach them at the same time instead of 2 different lessons.  I'm not sure if it is possible.\n\nI tried to do it on my own last year and it didn't work out too well.","It is a benefit having a teacher located in the Harrisburg office near us that we can visit on a regular basis.  In previous years, there appear to have been more field trips located at the CCA office than there have been this year.  We really found great benefit going to the teacher activity days at the office in the past.  Perhaps in the future, more trips could be planned for the CCA buildings.  It has been a great learning experience to go on field trips related to what our child is studying at the time.  The field trips coordinators (Brittany and Thelma) have done a great job setting up educational trips during the school year which directly apply to the curriculum and we hope that this will continue in the future.","Im happy.","The mentors are pretty non-existent.  During the orientation, they mentioned how the mentors are there for you and always check in to make sure things are going well.  I think that I heard from my mentor, maybe once, and that was it.","Overall, CCA is a wonderful school.  There are certain aspects of the curriculum that aren't perfect.  I know this is a work in progress.  My family has truly had a wonderful experience with the school and have recommended the school to others.","Have more responsive teachers, allow students to do vo tech classes","Can't think of anything at the present time.","Help deciding best classes to take to prepare for college","It would nice if it could be offered state to state.","There are still too many portfolios, even though that has improved over the past couple years. There is absolutely no need whatsoever to have that many portfolios submitted. There should be no more than ONE portfolio per subject per semester expected. Anything more than that is just plain burdensome and doesn't accomplish its intended purpose anyway. Quite honestly, my true opinion is ANY portfolio beyond 3rd grade (where actually seeing a student's handwriting is necessary) is completely unnecessary and impractical. \n\n PLEASE develop better curriculum. It has been my number one complaint for years and has driven me to research other schooling options every single year. This curriculum is outdated, boring, moves WAY too fast, and is unimaginative. My student is bored out of his mind (not because he's overly intelligent, but just because the content is presented in such a boring way) and every year, I think of so many ways that I could create a more fulfilling and fun learning experience for him. \n\nLive lessons are WAY too long in many classes.  Both my students have live lessons that are nearly an hour or often OVER an hour long! No one should have to stare at a tiny picture of a teacher going on and on and on for an hour plus. That wouldn't hold ANYONE'S attention. These overly long live lessons have led us to skip the lessons completely in all but two classes, which is a shame.","Only complaint is the \"overdue lesson list.\"  It is apparently not always accurate.  It has caused family arguments because we think our student is x number of lessons behind, only to find out some were eliminated or rescheduled so they were not due yet.  It would be very helpful if this list was more accurate.  Thank you!","they have done more for my child in these few months then reg school. i have no complaints","n/a","I am satisfied with the service we now receive, so I would just say keep it up.   Don't grow so big that you can maintain your focus and responsiveness on students and families.","Keep being flexible and allowing great field trip opportunities.","Have the elementary teachers actually teach the lessons not just concepts.","I can't think of anything at this moment.","teachers could be more helpful","Amelia social studies teacher could be more helpful because my daughter is an IEP student","The only problem I have ever had with CCA has started this past year.. Every other teacher my son has had has never minded my helping him understand something during a teacher/student phone call.. My son has had 3 different teachers this year due to different reasons. His current teacher got snippy with him when he asked me a question to help him better understand the question and told him that he should not be asking me for help, he should be asking her. I will never stop assisting my child understand something. It doesn't matter if he is on the phone with her or not. That situation has left a bad taste in my mouth concerning the newer group of teachers that CCA has hired this year. Better understanding teachers would be a greater asset to CCA than this teacher who has a chip on her shoulder. \n","They can't","N/a","We were sad to see the Hershey park trip at the end of the year stop.

The program is a wonderful outlet for parents who do not want their children in a stressful public school system.  I love the personal one on attention.  Your teachers rock!  I am a private school teacher, and I have never seen such hard working staff.  This is my second year enrolling my kids, and I am so pleased I started the process enrolling my third child.   I want to give a very special recognition to Mr. Tribbitt and Mrs. Bond.  They have gone over their duties to help my students both from last year, and this school year.","I can't think of anything at this time.","Make sure Tech Support has knowledge of software like Read180 and Math180.","n/a","I am completely happy with how CCA runs things now.","The message board system, to me, is very confusing. I rarely find the information I need there. There could also be more clarity on how to save up/use vacation days. I don't know how many we have saved up, nor do I know how to use them for dental appointments or just a well deserved three day weekend. How does the attendance thing work if they go on a field trip? For vacation or field trip days, do they still do all assignments from that day? It's very confusing to me.","Try to help and understand Autism and other disabilities.","Just keep being there Don't let what's happening with the state stop us from doing what's best, from the best, witch CCA is the best!!","It already serves me well, everything is great.","be a little more nicer and understanding\n","I would like it if, when it comes time for the ITR, a counselor for my high school kids would try to talk to me. It is very hard to get in touch them. In brick and mortar schools the counselor knows what you need for graduation and what you can take. At CCA I got \"talk to her English teacher, they might know better if she can take it\". I still haven't heard back from my sophomore's counselor. Gonna have to send another web mail today.","Maybe institute a consequence for the more overdue lessons a student has to help Them appreciate the necessity of staying up to date on track.","More and improved orientation.","CCA is a great school and I hope we will be able to continue our journey here.","More clubs/in more areas","Overall I have been very pleased over the years. James is my second child to enroll in CCA. Next year will be James' last year in school then we are simply not sure where we are going from there. This has nothing to do with the education he received but rather health and other personal issues we are facing.","Have the teachers remember, that there are IEP students in regular classes, mixed in with students \"without IEP'S\".  Sometimes the teachers move a little to fast, for the student with the IEP.","They are being incredible. We just need for her to be able to access school 24/7/ 365, and be able to proceed and go through things at her pace, (sometimes straight through);  as her body, mind and meds allow. The fact that some of the teachers are willing to work with her 1 on 1 at the center is fantastic if we can just get her there.","Not sure","CCA has done everything to meet our standards.  CCA teachers are the most competent teachers I have see in quite a few years.","CCA is doing all it can do.","I wished there was a class that goes a little bit slower with math.  My child takes in math at a slow rate.  It is hard for him.  Although the teacher is fantastic, he goes fast for my child.  He has a very enjoyable personality, for sure.  I think much of it is the curriculum itself.  For years my child has been in cyber schools &amp; for years I have seen his content.  The content in math spends very little time with basic math, and the math that we use in everyday life.  Instead too much time is spent with stuff unlikely to be used in everyday life.  I realize, the intellectual type of people will make claims that we use algebra, geometry, etc all the time.  However, I have not yet heard of a instance that is realistic.  And the situations I hear making the claims are very weak situations. (Finding the volume of a rectangular prism....c'mon, we all do this when we take care of the leftovers from the supper table...we don't need a formula for this) (Changing a recipe from a lb of chicken to oz. ........we have done this for years....conversion table)  I am not saying we shouldn't have this kind of content, but not so much of it that the grade becomes effected by it.  More emphasis should be on basic stuff.  My generation has great math skills and it is because of the time spent on learning them.  These are also needed to proceed to the other stuff.  Multiplication takes some serious time to fully take in.  It seems the schools today do not want that time to be taken fully.  And I don't care what anyone says, multiplying, division, adding and subtraction are much more important then algebraic puzzles.  These do not fit every day life.  Nor does geometry unless you plan on getting into certain fields.  Too much emphasis is spent on these things.  Although I learned a couple things myself with the common core strategies....overall, I think they are a horrible curriculum to be teaching.  It takes a person all the way around the mulberry bush to get a simple answer.  It leaves my kid in tears, telling me he is stupid and can't do it.  And I know my kid is not stupid.  He may be a bit slower in learning math, but stupid is not a word for him, for sure.  I have always been good at math and some of the stuff I have seen being taught to him....I have no idea what the curriculum is doing.  I do believe it explains why my son has such a hard time in math.  I think there should be a alternative math class that teaches the basics in full for elementary kids.  And the same class leaves out so much time for unnecessary things like algebra.  There is nothing in this world that basic math will not answer.  Learning how to balance a checkbook could be a good replacement.  I realize this will go no place.  But I definitely had to get my opinion in.  I feel bad for the kids going through the curriculum of today.  If it was not in every school, I would definitely seek out schools that did not get into common core 'cuz taking common core out would be a real plus.\nI also think it would be good to have a \"recess\" class for kids to hang out in.  It would help with the social aspect in my opinion.  Yes, there are outings.  Where I live, it is unfeasible to get the daily stuff in and attend.  They are too far away for us.  I also wished the pssa's were a bit closer as well.  I work nights and am usually so tired to be driving like I have been to get to these pssa meeting places.","prefer other theories besides evolution be shared and evolution be shared as the theory it is not as a fact which it is not","teach evolution as a theory because it is not a fact, and teach other theories as well,","I feel Some teachers do not pour into the kids as much as they should.","n/a","There is one teacher in particular that does not grade things promptly. Even after my child has asked her to, and even I have encouraged her to do so, she still lets grading get behind by units. This is highly frustrating when my child's grade is suffering from one particular assignment, but when he does well on the following assignments to raise his grade, there is no reflection for weeks until the teacher is reminded to grade them. My child likes to go back through recently visited assignments to reflect on the things he needs to work on, and it is hard for him to do that when a whole units and several lessons have passed until the teacher grades the assignment. She is constantly absent, and maybe that is why the grades are falling behind. It is just frustrating when my child is focused on doing well, and is trying to participate in sports at the local school, and is WAITING for assignments to be graded because they have a poor reflection on him being able to participate. Our math teacher last year was awesome, but this year's math teacher is not a good reflection of what CCA has come to mean to me and my family.","WE tend to do our schooling later in the day, it would be helpful to be able to watch the LL on our schedual ...

I never spoke to my mentor until we were settled in with CCA as our home.","I praised you for your dedication and well trained staff.

Some teachers are a better fit than others for my student.  Thank You!","no way I am very satisfied with it","It's hard to improve what is good now although everyone can improve we're very happy with CCA now","I believe the teachers should have to be more accountable in responding to e-mails.  Perhaps some sort of tracking on how long a response takes.  According to CCA teachers have 24 hours during the week to respond.  I don't expect that.  I do however expect a response within a couple days.  I have had multiple issues where I have sent multiple e-mails and never received a response.  To me that is unacceptable.  Perhaps teachers have too much on their plates?  Teachers should also be accountable for what they say they are going to do.  If you tell me you are going to send out something, weekly, monthly or in general....I expect that.","More field trips with teacher driven activities at the elementary level in the various offices (such as Reading days or Math days).  My son VERY much enjoyed the ones he attended and we would be willing to drive for more of them.  Maybe once per month? They were very well organized.","Once in a while meet with the children face to face.Along with the parents.","Continue to do what you already are. Remain flexible. Continue the approach that the Parents/Learning coaches are the ones working with children one on one and understand their learning processes best.",null,"n/a","More local social interaction opportunities","I believe that there should be a monitoring system put in place on communication.  I expect answers to communication.  This is my second year with the same issue, so I feel strongly others are facing this challenge as well.   Last year in order to remedy this issue I had to speak to the principle of the teacher.  This year...I am considering our other options.  The reason I selected CCA vs traditional home schooling was for the support.  Without communication from the teacher, or at very least an answer to e-mails asking questions, the reason for selecting CCA is void.  I think I would rather go at this alone, than with a support system that isn't there.","We are concerned about wording errors on Connexus tests.  It is my understanding that a third party creates these tests.  I am sure CCA teachers have reviewed them but we are still finding wording errors.  \nAlso, I agree with CCA that portolios are important but too many can be overkill.  I would not recommend this school to others because the workload is so heavy.","I wish that there were more educational and social events for the high school students and that they were not too far away from our area.  As well as a chance for the students to meet their teachers in person.  I know that the Elementary levels have grade specific field trips and I think it would be nice to have some for the older students as well.","When students email teachers our son gets messages saying he hasn't communicated with any one when they sent an email back , to me that is communicating, but let the student talk to a teacher if he or she needs to,not counting one as communicating and waiting 2r hrs plus , is the only problem my son has , he will call if need be","Give parents an option of substitution when there is a lesson they don't want their kids to do.","Just keep doing what your doing!

That would ultimately equip us with the solid foundation of support that ALL families could benefit from.","I am not really sure, we were in our previous school for 13 years and were looking for a positive change. I was also looking for somewhere my son was offered more help. I believe he has gotten that with simplified classes.","By not being soo rigorous with all those assignments. Plus, the assignments are way above a 7th grade level...even when I try to help my daughter with a problem, some of the curriculum blows my mind.","CCA can respond quicker to problem-solve our specific educational needs, and not make 'empty promises' that leave us in a very confusing and stressful situation all year long. Teachers need to work closer with Learning Support Staff, to ensure a more structured/mentor environment for Student/Learning Coach.","you all do a good job cant think of anything right now\n","CCA is doing a great job teaching my child we are learning we have to be more involved in his schooling","Have an office closer to where we live, maybe one in each county. Also,\nit would be nice to have a \"meet &amp; greet\" before school starts. That way we can meet my daughters teacher and possibly the kids in the same class. I realize though PA is a large state and that might be difficult, just a thought. My daughter really enjoyed meeting her teachers(in person) and some friends for the first time on Wednesday. It would been nice if that could happen before school starts.","Special Ed teachers should be more available and have multiple options for their classes.  If a child's IEP has speech in it and we have to leave the home to go to speech, we cannot be logged in for the social group that is being held in LiveLesson.  Then being told to watch the recording is unacceptable because that is not social interaction.","CCA has fulfilled all my needs to provide a wonderful education to my children.  We will miss it when we move.","We like everything about it. There really isn't anything that we can think of.","I have a child that went without a special education teacher (LST) from Sept to Feb.  During this time he received none of his CCA LST supports.  I asked from the start of the school year (Sept, Oct, Dec, Jan, Feb, and Mar)  if he belonged in his current general ed placement as I do not feel he is reaching independence in his studies.  It is now April and NO ONE, including Mrs. Manning has been able to answer this question.  Then to find out that Mrs Hoffman who wrote his IEP without ever even meeting him and who I also asked about his placement is the one that does the testing is very disheartening.  His regular ed teacher, Mrs. Roth, has gone out of her way to help me piece together his year.  He is about to enter Middle School without proper supports.  I have repeatedly reported the in home BCBAs to CCA (for both my boys) as not assessing, creating, implementing, or communicating a plan/program with the IEP team.  There has been no recourse.  A new company has been contracted and we are waiting on CCA to issue a PTR, respond to the BCBAs questions and update compensatory time.  There are on going issues with lack of responses.  A contract manager, not a member of the IEP team, trying to make changes to my children's IEPs.  I have webmailed Dr. Flurie with no respons.  Mrs Zozos is aware.","Getting started in a cyber school at the half way point was very hard for me to get an understanding of everything (calculating the attendance, knowing my way around the site, learning how to complete a lesson).  Everyone that I talked to was very helpful and kind.  It was more on my end with the adjusting to a new experience.  I would have loved this type of schooling in my day.","I would like for the videos to have subtitles. I m a deaf parent of a hearing child and I would like to know what is being said. Thanks","I would like for the videos to have subtitles since I m a deaf parent. Thanks","I am satisfied for the most part.  Many of the portfolios are extremely time consuming.","First grade has been way too easy. My son is finished already. He was a fluent reader in kindergarten. There is inadequate differentiation and true enrichment for young students. Though we will accelerate him to second grade early, he is too young chronologically to do that in a brick-and-mortar school. If he needs to transfer into one, he will be dramatically younger than his peers. He was already on the very young end of the spectrum for his grade. This was a problem with our daughter too - she accelerated a grade as well. Ultimately we withdrew her midway through 3rd grade because she was on her FIFTH teacher in 6 months. We also really burned out on the relentless test prep. I felt that the social studies content was repetitive year after year, too. We are generally pleased with CCA - that's why we've enrolled our son - I just hope that we don't have any more rapidly changing teacher issues, and I hope that test prep doesn't take over. I am a public school teacher and I understand the desperation for test scores, but there has to be more to school. Thanks so much for all you do!","I haven't give it much thought yet","Offer transportation for students in the southern portion of the state.  Also, it would be great if a student was having difficulty with a lesson, he should be able to complete other assignments and continue to work on that particular subject and come back to the lesson when he is more comfortable with it.  For example, he (my son) was having problems building his confidence enough to do a speech in literature and was falling further and further behind in English.  Unable to move forward, he eventually skipped the speech, accepted a zero and dropped his overall grade in that subject ten points (from an A to a B).  He was too insecure to talk to his teacher about the problems he was having.","n/a","My child has been with CCA since 3rd grade, now an honors junior.  I have noticed especially this past year we have had a few problems with some teachers, which is completely new to us.  Extremely slow grading with one of the teachers, another teacher states what she wants on the message board, but when all is done there always seems to be a problem.  This has happened several times this past year.  The contact number for another teacher is a fax number, which is frustrating. Just very inadequate this year from previous years.  I still think the teachers and staff are great, maybe just more students than they can handle?","You've done a great job","The special education teacher was non attentive ,she never communicated with my student. The field trip are too grade oriented and the titles are confusing. When you attend , the person in charge is not very attentive.

My kids have not gone on any field trips this year!   So the worrying about socialization really happened, and I am kind of upset.","The biggest complaint that I have about CCA is the quality of the teacher's voices in the LL rooms. The voices are often garbled, scratchy and just in general, hard to listen to. In the event that a teacher is actual clear, then it always seems that there is so much background noise, complete with other teachers doing LL, that it is hard for me as an adult to focus on just that one voice. With LL being so important in a virtual school, I am beyond disappointed that CCA accepts such low quality. The teachers are so amazing and have so many valuable things to say, it is very unfortunate that it is so hard for the students to actually understand them. Add into that equation, a student with ADHD and/or sensory issues and it is a complete disaster. I wish CCA would get teachers some quality headphones and have a more private area for them to hold their LL.","Have more field trips closer to our area.

Cut back on number of tests with every lesson.","I think CCA is doing a really good job already.","It is already good.","I am thinking of enrolling another child for the 2016-17 school year. I've noticed from K - 2nd grade a lot of material was repeated from previous years. I've only ever had one student enrolled at CCA.  So, I'm not sure if this is currently being done or not. But I was wondering if it's possible to have that repeated material line up so both of my sons are learning the same material just at different levels. I think this would not only be helpful for the learning coaches, but the students as well. They will be able to lean not only on the coach but each other for support.","Not sure if there is a way to set up something similar to the Co-op some home school students use.","The tests and quick checks are horrible.  At least once a day I find a question that amounts to a trick question just because of wording.  just ask straight forward questions.  Also, English tests are ridiculous this year.  A closed book and an open book test??? Are you kidding me.  Here's a novel idea, just put the 2 together.  Do you have any idea how hard it is to get your child to do a second test on the same stuff she just did a 25 question test???  Obviously not because it's in the curriculum.","better special education teachers","Have his general education teacher be more pro active with modifications. I feel I have to harass the teacher to get work graded and modifications given","Either get rid of portfolio's or at least lessen them, and absolutely positively get rid of the discussions.  When I check my kids discussions, all I see in responses is \"I agree\".  They are useless.  I'm sure that it makes someone feel really good that they made up this totally subjective question on how you feel about a certain situation, but in all honesty, how do you grade something on how someone feels.  It's not right or wrong on how they feel, that's how they feel.  So you waste 30 minutes of learning time putting your feelings down on paper and you get a 10/10.  As for portfolio's, we've done portfolios following the instructions only to fail them because the instructions were modified by the teacher.  It's particularly disheartening when they say you would have passed if we were doing it the way the instructions were listed but they were changed.  We enrolled in CCA because our kids are professional athletes, it was a good program at one time, but it has steadily gone downhill.  There's an old saying that \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\", so please stop trying to fix it.  I can tell my learning coach day is going to hell in a hand basket when I open my webmail and it tells me I have a video message from Dr. Flurie on new exciting things coming to CCA.  I just walk away with that I'm screwed feeling.","Not sure","My only complaint are the frowny faces on the homepage dashboard. My children are introverts and do not willingly reach out to teachers to chat on the phone. So having them listed as \"in alarm\" status is very disconcerting given that they are both good students.","No specific ideas at this time.","I would like some of the books to be updated.  I would like webcams provided for all children.","Consistent quality of programs.  The computer science coursework has been very disappointing.  Took a kid who loved programming and computers and made him not want to study it anymore.  It is not rigor -- he has a nearly perfect grade -- it is the lack of responsiveness from the teacher, the repetitiveness of the material, the way that the teacher is disengaged from the material.  He says it seems like the curriculum is totally independent from the teacher.  Like someone created an online course and put the teacher in charge, but the teacher is not connected to the material at all. \n\nWe chose this curriculum for the flexibility of the program.  With more HS teachers requiring live lesson attendance, this has impacted his ability to attend music lessons and band.","I  can't think of anything right now.","I think the special education department could do a better job in being more \"on top\" of getting evaluations completed and therapies started. I had a therapist request a physical therapy evaluation last year and have yet to hear anything about that happening. It's definitely been past the 60 day mark since she requested that via email to CCA. My other child had a neuropsychologist evaluation stating medical need for certain therapies at the start of the 2016-2017 school year, and services for her hadn't started until about a month ago. I feel like that process could have been completed sooner.","There needs to be better monitoring and accountability for students' emails.  The fact the students can email each other, delete the email and there is no way to track it is not safe and I have to monitor my daughter very closely because of that.  Either administration is unaware of how students are using their webmail system or they wish to ignore the seriousness of it because of the cost and time that would go into making the necessary changes. It is something that CCA should take very seriously and correct this issue immediately.","I am happy with CCA!\n","Are there other curriculum options available 7n case a particular way of lwarning does not work with an individual?","Better administrative communication often no calls back better parent teacher communication. And more local field trips and events in York PA ( our local area. ) Often the seminar s and events - field trips are few and far between. For that area.

And being a only child this is extremely IMPORTANT.cant stress that enough.","I am satisfied with CCA","There is some frustration with a very few teachers who take a long time to enter grades. Also, with attendance at live lessons  and phone calls not being credited toward the student interacting with their teachers (that approaching alarm status message every 2 weeks when calls etc have been done during that time has gotten really old).  The length of time it takes for the alarm status to update when teachers are called again to get it rectified.","Our family is very pleased with CCA as it is.  We will be seeking more detailed transition planning as my learning support student prepares for graduation; however, I am certain that it will be provided when we ask.","At the moment, I don't think there is any way CCA can better serve me.

Was trying to look up a teacher with the search box and could not do so. Had to figure out how to find the teacher info. on the parents page but had difficulty. Finally figured it out though. It should be made much easier by just searching.","I would like to see events/programs closer to us rather than Harrisburg.","I wish some of the field trips were closer to us, but it's understandable since PA is a big state.","The only problem we have really had is that twice a week 3 of the live lessons are scheduled at or near the same time and overlap so she has a difficult time choosing which one to attend, then ends up missing all of them by the time she decides.","A little frustrated at lack of communication with teachers/parents regarding the failure of subjects my child is currently taking","I would like to see answers to all posed questions. Not all lessons seem to have answers.\nI would also like to have study guides the kids can fill out to use to study. A few of the teachers have them but I don't think all of them do. Often the lesson says to look back over the last few lessons to revise; in practice this is very time consuming and not easy. If we had a simple study guides to fill out it would shorten and make study time more efficient.","The higher grades do not need to change a thing. For the lower elementary grades I feel like it would be more beneficial if live lessons were for every class. My child likes that time with the teacher. So if you could do a 30 min lesson for each class instead of  just for math and language arts that would be wonderful.","Continue everything that you all already do!","Have more PSSA SAT prep during Live Lesson classes","You all have done a very good job","My son will be in the special education program.

I told him that it was not a good change because my high-schoolers no longer attend live lessons, when they used to attend nearly all of them.  Even their teachers do not like the change.  He didn't bother to reply to my webmail, he just sent out a school-wide webmail to try to convince everyone that the change has been a huge success.  The whole thing must have been his idea or something, because he wouldn't listen to honest feedback.  I still might try to find a better cyber school for my highschoolers, because I'm still unhappy with the change.","More consistency in grading standards; less cumbersome portfolios; more interactive tutoring sessions as part of the classroom learning experience.","I'm really not sure. I have been happy, my daughter is happy. I only wish Pa. would have allowed my daughter to take college courses while attending high school. She wasn't very challenged in high school. I also wish Pa would address having different levels of classes rather than grouping them into the same curriculum.","By not giving subjects that the student does not really need, like algebra, game design, career planning, computer programming, et cetera.  What happened to the subjects like basic English, math, et cetera.  Only give the subjects that's required to graduate.","I only have one complaint. The art course is lacking very much. Art should be a fun course, kids should be following along while watching a teacher demonstrate art. My child came from a private school where are was her favorite class. Her art was in school auctions and has been displayed. In CCA art class my child does nothing but read and does not see the teacher demonstrating techniques.  I know this teacher is very qualified but my child has lost the love of taking an art class at CCA. I had to enroll her in a art program outside of CCA so that my child may proceed with her love of Art and learning new techniques and watching them being done.  I feel is CCA was to do this, it would be awesome. Also offer art courses to the older kids, for they to have talent and might want to pursue as well.","Webmail could be way better- I have to search for the person I want to contact every time through a drop down menu of EVERY person in the school. I can't create a frequent contact list, etc. The virtual library is atrocious. I am STILL trying to find the school calendar. Older things (like school test results) could be archived. There could be a Hot button for current year information-either in the virtual library or right on my student's or my home page. Running the scheduler in high school seems redundant. The schedule isn't flexible in high school, which is a shame because my son prefers to block lessons (Science on Monday, Math on Tuesday, etc) It is helpful for him to stay focused on one subject matter at a time. After speaking to families enrolled in other cyberschools, it seems CCA is the only one who requires portfolios. I can see writing papers in English, science experiments, but I think this whole process could be re-evaluated. A portfolio assignment in a core class will shut my son down for a week. Meanwhile, other assignments become overdue. Technical issues (which sometimes cannot be avoided, I understand this), however, LL that constantly freeze, or no sound or the recording doesn't match the sound with the slides. I completed a degree online, there are definitely other options that work well and more reliably. Modified assignments are tricky. Special education students have to SEARCH for these. A lot of my son's teachers this year are using Google docs to create their own tests, which I think serves the student better, but, my son, with poor executive functioning doesn't look for these things. It needs to be on his radar so to speak. Overall, finding information is difficult. Consistency is not always present--we have done assignments that came on the planner and when you get to the end---it was dropped, but doesn't show as dropped in the course tree. My son doesn't find career planning to be useful.","There has been a definite decline in responsiveness from staff, especially during the enrollment process and from the Special Education Department in the past year.  I also think CCA needs to provide better services for students that have IEP's.  There is no real remedial Title I services available to students who continue to have reading difficulties in the middle school grades, and even in the elementary grades, it's still lacking.  What exactly is the Title I monies being used for because I don't see it being used to support my student at all.","I cannot think of any improvements.  Please continue to hire the high quality and caring teachers to keep your program strong.","By having a regional parent forum and/or regularly scheduled meet ups. Field trips are nice but you don't usually see the same people often.   A regular meeting for a small area would help younger students and families that prefer real rather than cyber relationships to make lasting friendships.","It would be awesome if you had a parent message board; like a facebook or a forum type thing.  Have it grouped regionally so that parents/learning coaches can get to know each other, discuss school related topics and more easily arrange meet ups for the kids.","none","CCA could have better served by following through last fall on its commitment to the students of Java Programming I.  This course was one of the reasons CCA was more attractive than our local high school.  Now the local school is doubling down on its commitment to computer science, so our continuation with CCA is unsure.\n\nWhat can't be undone is the poor impression that this leaves with me as both a parent and an educator.  When the email came through with the bad news that Jordann Smith was taking another position within CCA and \"good\" news that the course was ending early with remaining expectations eliminated, this seemed the height of contempt for commitment to academic work.  Not only was CCA not committed, but it communicated to its students via email that less work for the semester was \"good news\".  This was a very poor attitude communicated by the coordinator of your elective courses.\n","More group events locally to me","We have had several teachers in just one year.

I think everyone has been so helpful from the first week when I couldn't figure out how to get rolling with the scheduler to the more recent everyday questions.  My kids really love CCA and I have seen them grow and mature in many ways.  I see both of them taking the initiative with their learning and learning to be self-motivated and proactive when they don't quite get the grade they hoped.  In my book these are great things.  I believe true learning is being a self-learner and someday when school books, college books, etc... have all closed, a child keeps learning and exposing themselves to new things.  It's when they don't know how to do something, they figure out a way they can learn it on their own or by taking a class.  These things create a truly enriching educational experience and an adult life filled with new and exciting things.","administration be more available by phone.

After repeatedly bringing this to the attention of the elementary administration the issue has still not been taken care of.

The program is encouraging students to self pace in the virtual lesson, that is an Honors program not Special Education. My son failed a test because he was a block(unit ahead).  Read180 has rather depressing subjects, child labor, suicide, runaways, immagrants- not a positive text to learn reading skills.

Her essay was a little weak, probably owing to the fact that she had no idea what direction she wanted to go in career-wise (that has changed).  She was also told that she did not do enough volunteer work.  I felt that this was unfair.  We don't belong to Girl Scouts because we are not Christians.  Without something like that, it isn't easy to find volunteer work for a child, especially with the new requirements for clearances.  With great difficulty, I found something for her.  She continues to maintain her GPA, and I sincerely hope she will be accepted next time as it will be her senior year.  I would ask you to review the criteria for selection.  I know she would have been easily accepted were she still in our local brick and mortar school.","Probably the best way that CCA can better serve me is by people answering my e-mails in a timely manner. Some of my e-mails don't even get answered. Not sure why.","I am already pleased with the program and if I had an issue I would tell you immediately.","I have nothing at this time.","I can't think of anything right now.","I think the mentor's should do a much better job, especially for a first year family. And staff could return calls faster.","The only things that disturb me about CCA and really I guess it isn't CCA'S fought but, doing away with the school's picnics I feel that the children work very hard during the school year and they deserve to go somewhere like Hershey or Knoebels Park which was a great place to go and enjoy with other students and teachers. Then, the second thing that always concerns me is why do the students have to travel to places for their PSSA's when all other work is done online? I have to travel for hrs. to get to the site that is having the PSSA's then you have to wait around for hrs. until they are done when I feel that the school should try and accommodate the families with a lounge area and some food or snacks while waiting for the student to get done. It is absurd for me to travel home and then come back out to pick up my student with the miles that I have to run. This is a concern not only for me but I had talked to a lot of parents and they feel the same as I do. Maybe in the future you might accommodate the parents as well. THank you.","Remove political agendas from curriculum and test children so they can work at their level in all subjects instead of blanket curriculum based on age.","I am very happy with the very good educational plan , the teachers have been wonderful, tech support is awesome and we love all our great Field trips. \nI do have one Big concern, I would like to see a BIG drop in the recent rise in Portfolios. We have almost 4x the portfolios in the second half of this year. Because of this huge rise, we are not enjoying the CCA experience as much, we can only worry about all the portfolios that need to be done. More stressful than fun or having a fun time learning. I was totally comfortable with the amount of portfolios for the previous year and the beginning of this year. This has really made my job as a learning coach with 2 small children a huge jump in time and more frustration for me and my kids. I know I am not the only one that feels this way , and would like to see more thought put into the lesson plans and what can actually be accomplished. I hope this opinion finds its way to an action that helps everyone.","At this time....cant think of anything.","I really can't think of anything right now....I am very happy with what CCA does now ......KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK","Allowing students to work through portfolios so they do not fall far behind in their work","I am very happy with all that they do for me now!","Sometimes be more clear about assignments.","I am very satisfied with the serve I currently receive","They do a good job","They already do a good job","better communication and proper response time","I'm already getting the best serves","Satisfied","unsure","i really think they did a great job the 4 1/2 years my child attended the program","come to my house","Make sure the schoolwork coincides with the instructions in the books being used for all classes","Everything is fine the way it its","na","Nothing, I think you do a fantastic job.","By continuing to be flexible. For the elementary level I would like to see more options for portfolios if possible. I would also like to see directions be more age appropriate where my child can follow instructions with little supervision. I think some of the assignments are too complicated to follow for his age and it would help build confidence by doing this. I have a child whose in high that makes more modifications and for my elementary level child no modification are made.","give individualized survey's for each child, more options portfolios, the wording on the tests and portfolios seems very complicated \n","I am very happy with CCA's services and can't think of anything else.","Like I mentioned earlier, the portfolios can be very time consuming.  Our 8th grader spent 3 hours just on her science portfolio the other day, and this seems to be the trend in the higher grades. \n\n I also feel that the middle school grades should be required to have spelling tests.  I am horrified at what some of her classmates type in the chat pod on their live lessons as well as on the discussion boards.  Their grammar and spelling is worse than what my 4th grader types.","You do great","At this point I believe CCA has covered everything that we need.","Some lessons were unclear and we had a lot of problems with the equipment.","Education technology is a big old waste of time, to be blunt. Please get rid of this class!!","More parental tools","I would like to know more about the school tailoring assignments to meet the child's needs. So far, my child is struggling tremendously, but I'm not really seeing extra help.","It would be nice to have more connections with other parents. There used to be more field trip opportunities and now there aren't as many and the price went up. There aren't as many activities for elementary kiddos to get involved in to feel like they are a part of the school, especially in a rural area like we live in. \nThe only other complaint I have is with special education help. My student has been in extra reading classes since kindergarten,  and still every year she has to wait MONTHS to start these classes again. I feel that she should automatically be placed in these classes until she tests out.  Not waste half the year with testing and paperwork before she can even get help.  We have had to do a lot of the work ourselves here to help her move forward. It seems that every year there is some new program CCA is trying out and no one is organized :( The kids are the ones being hurt by this, and it should really get ironed out before the new school year even starts. Sorry to vent a bit,  but it is a big deal for us here with a struggling reader. Other than this issue we absolutely love CCA.","All of the teachers should have to obligated to help the student on the same level.  Mrs. Mary Frances Thorn told me no one ever helped her along her educational path. My son only attended CCA and I did not expect to have a negative attitude after CCA curriculum was a great asset for his future education but his experience with two teachers ended up in hurting his overall experience.","Have no question this school is terrific!","Hard decision to choose a college and how to get grants?","Maybe more social events","Nothing I can think of","Have goal setting classes for high school and guidance class for focusing on who they what to become.

My daughter knows no other school other than yours. She has been with you since kindergarden and she is now in 6th grade.","CCA is doing everything above and beyond what was expected","For our family, I would have liked to see more live lessons for my 5th grader, so there would have been more instruction on lessons and maybe less live lessons or planner work for my special needs 8th grader. I didn't see many, if at all, opportunities for socialization for my children in my area.","I really miss the extra live lessons.   If we had to miss a lesson the recorded lesson was available.  My student needs the extra teaching.  We chose CCA originally due to the amount of live lessons.  It was very similar in schedule to a brick and mortar school for those that are not easily self taught.  Our experience this year was a let down after our 2 previous years.  We went from 4 live lessons to 2 in most areas and from 2 to 1 in others.  CCA is just like all the other cyber schools now.  I still like the cyber idea, but CCA no longer is above and beyond all the rest.","the teachers and the staff can respond a lot better to emails and calls and actually walk or explain how to do certain things on here when the child doesn't understand and when a child enters this school after the start date don't expect them to play catch up in the work when they where not there from the start !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","You can't make it any better than it already is. My daughter has been with you since kindergarden and will be with you for the rest of her school years.","HAVE BEEN WELL SERVED","I would like to see more social events to allow for more peer interaction in person.  The field trips don't always promote that due to time constraints. In addition, there isn't enough field trips within the region or more that are non-paying and simply allow for the children to get together and mingle.","you can't make it any better than it already is.","Bring back the end of the year get together.","Continue to treat every child as an individual. Every child learns differently and CCA embraces that.","I can not think of one thing, which is what is awesome about CCA! Thank You for everything!!","They are already the best","CCA is already a very outstanding school and always easy to get help if needed","nothing of note","By making the lesson plans and little more simplified because some can be confusing when there is 3-4 books needed for one lesson.","I am extremely happy with CCA and the service you provide.","I cannot think of anything else CCA could possibly do better.  We are extremely satisfied with all aspects of this school.","I honestly don't know how they could do anything better.  We think CCA is wonderful!","I think the response from the teachers needs to improve.  There are many teachers in this school year, I as the learning coach and parent, have not even talked to.  My son was failing two separate grades and not one teacher contacted me to tell me he was in trouble.  I was 9 months pregnant, in and out of the hospital with complications and I had no help from most of his teachers.  I think contact should of been made that my son was having issues regardless if I was pregnant or not.","I am satisfied, as is.","Nothing I can think of right now","They are already amazing","keep doing what you guys are doing","A sports program or club that actually meets instead of video conferencing.","Tech Support has always been a burden for me. For example, I am positive that my son's computer needs a new battery but I cannot get one from tech support unless I talk to someone over the phone in order to trouble shoot. I rather not do that, so we just keep the computer plugged in at all times. Any other issue I have would apply to all public schools (Common Core Math and PSSA testing).","only have trouble up loading the portfolios to the teacher.","I feel that the computer that my son is using is too old. I would like him to have a new school issued computer.","Give back the flexibility that you claim is a Benefit of cyberschool\n","More freedom for Learning Coaches.

We always have all our work completed on time and my daughter has good grades. I don't see the need for contact every two-three weeks.","At this time, I feel that CCA is providing all that we need for a quality education.","We are already very well served.","It will serve better if there was an easier way to enroll in the PSSA'S because I'm not real technical with a computer my daughter is so sometimes Im not sure and I ask her.","I think they are good I don't have any complaints","I don't know of a way...","we are good","n/a","na","I don't really have anything that I can think of right now.

It is his own fault but it would have been nice if teachers noticed and contacted him to see if they could suggest anything or help in any way. He is brilliant but his perfectionist tendencies put him behind.","The only thing I dislike about CCA is the use of Common Core Math.  BUt I understand that is through the state and I would have to deal with this anywhere she went.","Provide ink for printers twice a year.","I WISH the government would STOP trying to dictate my child's education. We know our children better than some official.  They are all influenced by money, not by what is right.\nMy child has improved 60% since coming here.  The public school system is concerned with it's MONEY, not my CHILD!","It would be nice if CCA gave families a choice of getting a debit card instead of a check. Since I do not deal with banks, I always lose a portion of my subsidy to fees.","She needs a new computer but don't know how to get one","Maybe have more meet and greets with students and parents from their area within 10-1 miles so they can make friends who live close by.

I sometimes have trouble finding the details, and I lose track of when they are due.","n/a","Although I really love CCA, I have been increasingly dissappointed with the services provided to the students/families over the last few years. As with all schools with the budget cuts, CCA has cut services directly related to the students. We as parents would like to see the yearly financial reports. Has CCA cut staff or other services? Or just student-related services?","Unsure.","We would like a more timely and more in depth answers from the teachers when asking questions other than student is not following instructions.  We would like to see grade books updated in a more timely manner.  We would like to see tests and assignments that are in the email updated in our planners also and not just in our emails.","I am very satisfied with CCA.  I do have a few suggestions to improve the overall experience. 1.I would like to see more live lessons for younger children.  La and math are great but science and social studies are important to be taught in LL too. 2. I would like to see a consistency in information provided by teachers ie syllabus for lessons taught each week. 3. I would like to see the new field trip rules changed.  I feel my children have missed far too many educational as well as social oppurtunities because of the rules.  I think families should have the oppurtunity to self pay for additional trips.  Overall CCA has been a great choice for my girls.  With more consistent structure I feel CCA can be a fantastic cyber charter school!","PLEASE stop having the teachers send so many emails. I do not need to have a reminder of every single live lesson, or every assignment feedback in my inbox. The important emails get lost in the shuffle.","keep doing what you are doing","if there was one on one . help","i am very happy with CCA.","Everything is good","Nothing","not sure","We miss hands-on science labs. \nThe busy work classes like skills for success and  Ed tech, while useful at times, take more time and energy than they should for experienced cyber students. \nCurriculum is becoming more and more stupid. Examples: pushing sex ed agendas on younger kids, talking down the founders of the nation, singing soft and sweet about Muslim predators who \"tolerate Christians\" (enslave and tax them) while Christian Europeans are depicted as \"intolerant\" and \"aggressive\". I wish I had specific references, but I don't. There is a mindset sneaking into texts about our culture and the very moral basis of our family standards. It's not CCA's fault, in a way; I blame Pearson. I would love it if our school was neither owned by Pearson nor beholden to them in any way. Freedom of choice means- more choices!","Try not to have the planner so far ahead of the class because my child feels the need to be up to date and does not want to fall behind.","Let us choose the times of the middle school and high school live lessons. Obviously there is more than one class a day, to pick them would be more convenient for our schedule...but they can always watch them back.

The communications from everyone, from those giving us information, to those that are available for help down to our child learning part and his enjoyment has been well enough that, we cannot think of anything at this time that could really change our experience at CCA because it has been a great one.","Teachers could engage a little more when a child gets backed up with overdue lessons.

I can't think of anything.","Overall our experience with CCA has been positive.","I'm not happy at all with the timing on receiving any of the equipment when there is a problem. It takes way too long to receive things. That department is also not prepared at all with having enough equipment on hand to be sent quick enough. It's horrible how long its taking to get a printer (even a set of headphones). I ordered something online a few days after my sons equipment that's being replaced and they got here the same day? Something definitely needs to be done about that. That is my only complaint!","Unsure.","CCA could better serve my family and other families by cutting out so MANY, MANY portfolios and reduce the content and context of the portfolios. The portfolios also need to be moved out of the lesson schedule and just simply be due on a certain date, so students don't get hung-up doing a portfolio and then get behind in their lesson schedule. I think less quick-checks and portfolios and more time given to actually learn the material instead of seeing how much we can cover in one year.","Please bring back unlimited field trips.  These are so important for the kids.  It is their way of meeting up with their CCA friends and to remain social.  When you can only attend one \"paid\" trip a month, a lot of the time you have to hope their friends picked the same one.  We built friendships last year at field trips and it has been difficult to meet up with them this year.  Field trips were one of the factors in picking CCA as our cyber school.","Please open up field trips again and make them unlimited.  These were great ways for my kids to make and keep up with friends.  Now if we get to see them once a month, we are lucky.  These kids need to have that social time with others in their school so they can hang out with other students who are going through the same things.","n/a","I'm very satisfied with everything at CCA","Even though the teachers here are great, some of them could be a little more enthusiastic when talking. Some of the teachers can put you to sleep when talking.","There needs to be modified classes in subjects other than reading and math for students with IEPs and learning disabilities.  This year 5th grade SRA students are piloting a program in Schoology for Science and Social Studies.  My student just started this program and it is more on her level.  The students with IEPs have a hard time even with modifications to achieve success in these courses (example: my daughter's reading is at a Kindergarten/ First grade level; however, Science and Social Studies material is at a Fifth grade level-- it's too much for her).  The pilot program seems to be helping her at this time.  She is not so overwhelmed and shutting down during these classes.  I would love to see this be an option for student who need this at any grade level. \n I know my 6th grader is struggling a lot this year with the increased workload and difficulty of the curriculum.  She has an IEP, as well.  Her reading is behind, but not too far behind.  She struggles with processing information and this year she has many more modifications than in the previous years, but an alternative Science and Social Studies class option would be helpful.  I do not want her to drop these courses completely.  These are important subjects to learn, but she is not going to be able to get everything from these classes.  She need the \"meat and potatoes\" or main points, but she gets lost in all the details.","Improve communication between special education teachers and homeroom or individual subject teacher (depending on grade).  Currently, this is good.  However, there are times when it is slow (more on the regular teacher's end).","I really cannot think of anything I am dissatisfied with.

If there was a way to implement a closer office or for arrangements to be made to transport the less fortunate children, this would be the perfect alternative to public schooling","Try to get away from confusing and ridicules common core curriculum.","Continued, constructive feedback from teachers is essential to drive instruction and promote success.  This is especially true for children in asynchronous programs.  My child has/had amazing teachers who strive/strove to establish a connection and support academic and social/emotional growth.  Unfortunately, my child recently had one teacher who provided little to no feedback over the course of an entire semester.  Although this did not seem to affect my child's grades, it did affect her desire to set and reach goals.

As for learning languages, I don't see why it shouldn't be offered for very young students.  They are capable of learning a different language early on.

Sign Language needs a book or software program, not links to free software that is difficult to search and has pop-up ads. The health elective is difficult, the online lessons in a font that is almost unreadable it is so small and the class needs a book. The new special ed reading program lessons are fine but the read 44 software is boring for my child, 20 minutes spelling lesson with no rewards. The math 180 program takes too long on a particular topic and my child is not getting a variety of math topics. For example, they have been on fractions since the beginning of the school year. The math 180 program has games as a reward which is  a plus but takes very long drawn out methods to get to an answer. For example, to multiple fractions, they use a 8 step process. Science should have more labs. When parents give feedback the teacher's, the program coordinator and the principals should all listen. I have had principals in the past who never replied, even when it was a compliment. The read 44 program coordinator said the problems my son was having with the software was our internet and that we had too many people streaming programs at home. Meanwhile, as a programmer I had sent a thoughtful explanation of the errors and how HMH could fix it and explained that we had a hard wired DSL internet and only my son was on the internet and neither my husband nor I were on the internet. You need to respect and reply to parents.","CCA does a great job. Keep up the great work.","N/A","I believe CCA is doing a great job.","With so much college prep on the horizon, it would be nice to receive alerts on testing and activities that need completed and alerts on when.

And some kind of check mark system to see if child attended each live lesson that day.","Try to get rid of Common Core.","The curriculum is sometimes all over the place -- it would be nice for those with an educator's eye to go in and clean up some of the errors and consider the child on the other end. The math teacher is amazing, but the math program goes way too quickly and we are having to spend a lot of extra time reinforcing and finding supplemental materials because the text and the program rushes through the concepts or only touches upon them superficially with not a lot of examples; at the same time, some of the curriculum feels like overkill -- too much of the same thing over and over.  I wish it felt more consistent and uniform. \n\nAlso, the \"electives\" that aren't credited courses NEED to be disclosed upfront. The \"integrated\" curriculum course that turned out NOT TO BE INTEGRATED, was presented as part of my son's schedule and then I later learned it wasn't mandatory, and I'm not sure why it wasn't disclosed upfront. \n\nWe've also found minor errors/typos throughout the year on the tests and in the lessons; at first, it was no big deal; people make errors, but when it has been dozens of minor errors here and there, it starts to be frustrating and I wonder why teachers aren't noticing them. \n\nOn a last note, though, for the most part I really like the texts and most of the teachers have been wonderful. We also love Brain Pop as a supplement -- what an awesome learning tool! I'm not a fan of technology or movies taking the place of a teacher, but much of what my son has gained from the program has come from the Brain Pop videos and our further exploration of the concepts they cover.","not requires labs for classes its hard for people to obtain the proper supplies and also hard to teach the stuff to my child","Fix the glitch that does not show when my child attends classes. Not sure if this is her laptop that is the issue but she constantly shows alarms and I physically see her login to classes.","My child is a special needs teen. There are no electives for the special needs kids in the high school although I believe they are required to take electives. \nMy daughter, in our town public HS, has registered for a drawing class for one of her electives. Perhaps it would be possible to have a simple, step by step drawing class for the students and perhaps a cooking class as well. \nLast, I am very supportive and thankful for CCA and how far my son has come with the help of his teachers. However, the Read 180 program, although the strategies are helpful, the content of the stories seem to be geared towards inner city students or at risk students... ex. survivors, killer plagues, combat zones, your brain exposed, crime, punishment and teens? The selections just don't seem appropriate for special needs teens. In fact, whereas I usually read and reread selections with my child, this year I chose to skim over many parts. Perhaps for next year there is another SRA series or a Read180 program with more uplifting and appropriate stories.","This year's teachers, Yellow 'Team' 7th grade were the worst we've had since we enrolled in 3rd grade. They insist that their schedule is followed daily &amp; only kids who attend their live lessons get special bonus points. This is supposed to be a learning environment at your own pace. It isn't. Ms. Griffins insists they don't fall behind or work ahead. Ms. Keim has walked out of live lessons when the kids frustrate her. Ms. Boost was emailed when we needed help, only to be told 'Come to LiveLesson'. We do. Every day. Their Friday tutoring is only on whatever they feel like tutoring on. Students can't ask individual questions. It is ridiculous. I am having to 'teach' more than I did in elementary school. No wonder PSSA scores are awful.","Access to field trips could be better, especially for parents that do not drive. Also, material for selected courses, like Spanish, could be requested and sent with school material at beginning of year.","This program is excellent.

I honestly do not feel that there is anything else that could be done to serve us better.  We have been quite satisfied with CCA.","Technology.  The laptops my children received are old and slow with an outdated version of windows.  Also, some of the links they are required to use have spyware attached and have created some issues throughout the year.  But the big thing is the quality of the laptops could be greatly improved.","Easier access to field trips, perhaps provide transportation.","Admins need to be better at communicating and return calls/emails.

A teacher left CCA, several other teachers were reassigned; all of which was disruptive to our schedule and confidence.  (Especially, losing a great Math teacher!)

My daughter will sometimes have to work for 10 hours just to complete everything she is asked to do. Sometime a teacher will assign a test, she will take it and then the teacher will have changed the plan and assign another test. It happens often, and it's very confusing. If there is a plan.... Stick to it! Some of your students are ambitious and get ahead.","You need to provide MUCH more supplies to your students!!  The science curriculum requires many resources that many students don't have.  Give them the soil, rocks etc to complete these tasks.  Give them protractors etc.  You focus too much time on just math and language arts.  If a child has a question in science or social studies they have to figure it out on their own or wait for a teacher response.  These kids need actual live lessons in these areas as well.  These subjects are equally important, and it seems they are just an after thought in your school.  Having one hour of just LA and math is a huge disservice to these kids.  Also, the LA curriculum is too rigorous. You have these kids reading books on their own, plus books for a lesson.  They are spending soo much time reading and writing book reports and summaries, and barely touching on LA subjects like syllables, C/VC words, word sounds etc. Teachers need to follow the book or at least let parents know when they are veering from the textbook or workbooks.  Some lessons in math are not even covered by a live lesson.  Your new teachers with minimal experience need to be monitored more.  Our teacher is rude, abrasive and more concerned with being in control than having fun, fixing her hair in the web monitor, being prepared and teaching.  If the teachers are more prepared there wouldn't be so much down time in a live lesson.  Down time in a live lesson is a death sentence to little kids...their attention goes out the window and they get distracted.  Additionally, there are very few social activities at CCA as compared to other charters.  You need more interaction for these kids.  Field trips, book fairs (actual books in an office to come and look at, not just a flyer), art classes, music classes.  And make MUCH MORE of an effort to get these close to all kids. Westmoreland County has barely any resources available to their kids via CCA.  We have to travel too far.  You also need to give parents a better step by step guide on teaching lessons.  Many lessons will start by saying \"Remind your child what ___ means\"  or \"Start by explaining ___\".  No!  Give the explanation to the parents.  There are many parents who don't have the skills or knowledge to teach their kids.","Nothing","Nothing","Keep your teachers so that the children have stability, make sure to listen to families when they say theyou are having difficulties and help fix the problems instead of making them worse.  Keep to your word. When we enrolled in connections acadamy we enrolled in a school that had flexibility for learning and time and travel. Every reason we signed up for is no longer valid according to Mr Natale who is trying to ruin my oldest sons senior year, which has been continuing to get harder with another new teacher who decided to give him permanently zeros without warning him she is not staying with the old teachers rule of taking their time and turning in great work. She gave no notice that he would get permanent zeros just gave them and said oh well. This is his last few months of high school, he is a merit scholar recipient a straight A student and hard worker but also a perfectionist.

They can not expect the same level from IEP students, and need to better understand not to give the same kind of work load to students with these severe IEP.  Some Gen Ed teachers seem like they do not understand why they need to adjust, and do not know how to talk to or work with students with sever learning disabilities.","na","Stop having assigmnemts outside of the assigned assignments.

Yes, we have been in regular contact with his teachers, but that only helps so much with a child he suffers in unknown ways and feels lost and left out because he thinks and handles thing differently than other children his age.

Also, it would be great if, instead of the Community Class Reimbursement, the class could be paid upfront by CCA.  A lot of families can't afford to pay the costs, even if they are getting reimbursed.","One way we could be better served is that when my child has the option to take the modified test. We usually have to wait until the teacher gets to grading it sent by email. Where as if they modify the actual test, so it can be entered right in the actual test, then the student can move on.  Now we have to wait until the teacher grades it through email and then we get lessons behind because we cannot move on.  Or the teacher knows what students take the modified tests, they can skip over the actual test in the lesson so the student can move on until the teacher gets the modified test graded.","none its great they way it is","fine as is","Everything has been wonderful.","CCA does a great job of serving me, so at this moment, I cannot think of anything.","things are going well so far","At this time I cannot think of anything.","no ways","Don't know.","your doing everything GREAT","i really wish they would choose to focus more on subjects that are needed for life skills--and especially to ones that are IEP students","More local field trips.

Foremost, CCA could establish a relationship with Butler County Community College (BC3.)  They are a wonderful resource for students in our area - which is in close proximity to the Seven Fields office.  BC3 offers the \"Presidential Scholarship\" to local students who demonstrate excellent academic performance.  This is my families 8th year with CCA.  My son, a junior, has a 4.0. If he was a student of our local district (either cyber participant or in the actual classroom,) he would receive free tuition at the community college.  This isn't being offered to him as a student of CCA because no relationship exists.  I believe that it would be a benefit to CCA to reach out to BC3 to establish that relationship on multiple levels.\nA second way that CCA could serve us better is to provide more text books.  Over the past 8 years, we have witnessed a major shift in the text books being provided to my students.  Resources that were provided to my older student are not being provided to my younger student.  This is discouraging as it was one of the major reasons that we chose CCA.  My students do better with physical, tangible books.  We have requested them, and have been repeatedly told that the same curriculum that my older student had received prior - isn't available.\nThe major way that CCA can serve us better is opportunity/event proximity.  Both of my students are in the National Honor Society.  There is to be a luncheon and ceremony at the end of the week in Harrisburg - several hours away.  We live in Western PA.  It feels that we are often forgotten and left out.  We have experienced the ups and downs in the growing pains of CCA, and have tried to be realistic in our expectations.  We have witnessed much progress for instance, when PSSA testing locations went from being 50 minutes of travel time away from us to 10.  Unfortunately, that has again changed, and the sites are no longer local for us.  \nEach year, we must weigh the pros and cons of continuing with CCA.  I have seriously considered switching to the local school district's cyber school, for the use of actual text books, close testing, and most important to us is the huge financial benefit of being able to receive scholarship funds.  I do hope that you will equally consider these items.","I'm honestly not sure\n","CCA does such a great job. I can think of no way to improve on their excellence!","Improve the hardware available to all students","Coca does such a great job, I can't think of any way to improve this school!","Sometimes middle school teacher have quite a bit of meetings and workshops, would prefer they have more time to do Live Lessons.","Some of the teachers are teaching chapters in live lesson that do not align with what is due on the school planner. They are teaching at times an entire unit ahead and it's hard to catch up to them. It is better when teachers are teaching concepts or chapters that are right on target (within a lesson or two) of what is on the planner.","CCA does a great job on everything that we have seen.

I wish that this decision could be reevaluated. The Adventure club was a small group of students that formed a strong bond with each other. It only met once a month and the students looked forward to seeing each other at the events. It will be very much missed since it served as one of my daughter's only social outlets. Please reconsider it's removal.","There should be more time allotted for live lessons for the AP classes - these are very challenging courses and to meet only once or twice a week is too little.","they do it all now","It seems as though this year CCA has been more disorganized when it comes to getting answers and finding out who to speak with at times. I also think the high school workload is a bit much.","They do everything now.  I don't see how you can be better than the best","As a parent, I have been satisfied with CCA.  However, I have found this past year that students need more opportunities for Live Lessons and study guides.","Everything is great","All around we have been mostly happy with CCA, the only trouble I would like to see fixed is with some of the curriculum. On several occasions the guide book did not have the correct answers or did not have answers at all. Other times on some of the online work I could not find some of the answers even with the tech support.","have class for parents to take so they know what to do.","Everything is okay for now.","I already gave my comments in the last slide.","Keep me updated on my grades and assignments","I am very,very thankful for Live Lessons. I believe all 3 of my children excel and thrive because of them. I would like to see them offered at every grade level everyday of the week as if they would be in a brick and mortar school.","fields trips I think could be better to find on the site, I wish they were right on the home page for the coaches or we could maybe get a reminder that something is coming up. I am still learning how to read the kids grade books","Doing good so far","By continuing to offer services that you have now","My only complaint it some of the learning material isn't age appropriate.","Cannot say at this time because all is well","Keep up the great work.","Focus more on teaching and less on test results to compare to other schools. Make it more fun and the kids will excel and want to do better rather than feel forced into having to achieve high scores. Lose the common core. I don't think it's necessary to do 6 steps for a 1 step problem that, in all honesty, does not get used in real life.","We are new to this type of education but so far has has worked well.","nothing cause everything is just fine","everything is fine","Have more options in the Edinburg Pa. area for field trips","I have no complaints","100% Satisfied with all aspects of CCA","I would like to see less holidays incourperated into our learning since our religious beliefs don't follow them.","I don't have any suggestions at this time.","I can't think of anything right now.","CCA could offer PSSA tests online at home.","As a newly enrolled family this year, I felt that the technical things were difficult to get in order. For example, I had to contact tech support numerous times to try and get my sons head set to work for his Live Lessons. The resolution finally came from a suggestion from his teacher after I reached out to her. Also we were never contacted nor were we given any information on a family mentor, until just literally 2 weeks ago. It would have been a HUGE help in the beginning of the school year.","I have no complaints","school needs better accountablility for special services. \n\nschool needs better help for parents\n\nschool needs to stop pettiness\n\nschool needs  review courses\n\nschool needs spelling help and review program\n\nschool needs teacher to not be so snotty\n\n\n\n","Lessons that are posted not changed multiple times per subject.....it's a search and find for the correct lesson.

They have done extremely well.","more hands on with the learning mobile aka chemisty or biology labs","keep doing what they are doing","By keeping up the good work that they are doing","Not really sure","At this moment you don't need to do anything.","Everything is fine.","More recent technology for seniors","You did a great job thank you","More social activities.","I don't know","Sometimes you can hear the other teachers in the background during a LiveLesson, and it can be very distracting. That is my only concern, at this time.","Not sure","Can't think of anything in particular.","Having a class for parents, so we understand a little better on classes","We are totally satisfied with all aspects of CCA, but I feel comfortable that if I would think of something, that I could talk to someone at CCA they would be more than happy to take time to listen.","It would be nice if there was someone other than the teacher to answer questions to problems in a lesson when the teacher is unavailable.","There should be someone to answer questions about lessons when the regular teacher is unable to so parents and students do not have to wait days for an answer.","You have all done wonderful!  I couldn't have asked for more!","I think  supplies of ink would be great","Answer questions faster and more on point with the answer for my child and to deal with issues on a timely manner and with me not everyone else but me.","supply ink","YOUR SERVICE CAN'T REALLY CHANGE WHEN IT IS PERFECT THANK YOU FOR MAKING SCHOOL EASY AGAIN FOR MY SON AND ME.","I have no recommendations","We just started and so far everything is great","We don't have any complaints at this time.","N/a","nothing as of right now.","I am not sure at this time","N/A","im happy","I believe there needs to be more social activities for the High school age students.  They need to be part of a group the same age.  Whether it is just a get together.  Perhaps food supplied by parents/caregivers or bring your own.\n\nNot be able to attend more than one $$ field trip.  We have offered to pay but are told NO NO NO!  Previously we attended many of them.  This school term we can count them on one hand.  Some are not age appropriate for a 17 yr. old but many are.  There are a numbers of family we have not seen this season because of the rule.\n\nSTEM is a fantastic program.  We have taken our grandson to every one offered at Seven Fields. (western PA)  He was not interested in the \"beauty\" one.  Thank you for this program.","Be able to attend more than one of the $$$ field trips.  (Even if we had to pay for it ourselves).  Socialization is a very important part of the teens life.  Also having autism makes socializing quite important.  Really miss the end of year get togethers where we meet the families and teachers.","need more guidance in course selections for high school students.","Clearer directions on assignments. A minority of the teachers consistently change expectations on the assignments. They differ from the syllabus and cause a great deal of confusion having to go back and forth between the updated expectations and the original expectations. Also, the verbosity of the expectations is excessive. It leads to confusion. Clearer, more concise expectations would be beneficial.","N/a","I have had only positive experiences so far","It would be nice to see classes that start together move up a grade together.  My son made several good friends in kindergarten and they were from the same part of the state but they didn't end up in first grade together and he really missed them.  I was able to request that he be put in their class for second grade and they were all happy to be back together again so it would be nice if classes were moved up together so that friendships can form, it is hard enough in this environment to make friends since they don't necessarily meet face to face so maybe there could be a form sent to the parents when they file their intent to return where they could request either a teacher or classmates that their child would like to remain in class with.","I am pretty satisfied overall with CCA. The only thing that might make it better is to have more satellite locations.","Make it easier to get in touch with tech support. More support for children with learning disabilities in high school level.","The resource books are difficult to follow. We have been with other cyber schools and one had books that had the pages marked by school days. For example, the lessons for the first day of school where marked Day 1. Everything required for that day (worksheets and lessons) was marked Day 1. It was also all together. You did not have to search through the book to find worksheets for each lesson. This made it easy to follow.","Put all the book work and pages they need to do for each subject on page one or two . It will help them be prepared , have all books needed right away. They shouldn't have to go through each page to find what they need to do . Most times they miss a book , page or two cause they are hard to find . It would be less stress to have listed all on one end page . That is the biggest problem with cca , needs to be more clear for the kids to succeed .","My oldest daughter is in High School.She is doing fairly good in her classes.But my younger daughter is in special ed.and is doing good in her live lesson classes that are specifically for special ed.But her general courses are a great struggle for her,and it is very difficult for her to pass these classes(social studies, science and on line learning)due to it being too hard,and not spending enough time on each subject before jumping to the next.Other than that,everything is good.","Closer location for grade level graduations. I don't feel the Spanish program is adequate. My son is not interested, he loses focus and isn't really catching on, the live lessons were not what I expected and only made my son and I both more confused, he is not interested in that extra class again next year. The educational technology program is also not one of our favorites, the program is hard to set up with all of the extra downloads, and he doesn't really catch on to any of that information either.","CCA is a fairly good school.But with my child that has special needs,I feel her needs were not met.The curriculum is too difficult for her and it has been a very big struggle for her.Her requirements for her classes were modified,but the course work did not change,it is the same,only shortened.So that did not help her.She has really had a hard time this year,and it has changed my opinion of it from last year.","Explain better why I have to complete her assignments before they can be graded.  Better explain what counts for attendance.  A physical handbook instead of trying to find the information online.","n/a","In the math curriculum the parents need access to how to work out a problem not just the answer to some questions, so we can better help our students. There are too many live lessons, taking up too much of the day, and removing the flexibility that we need. There are frequently contradictions between directions for portfolios from teachers and lesson plans, there needs to be clarification. Tests and quizzes in several of the 10th grade classes are dropped within the lessons but are added elsewhere making them difficult to find and easy to miss. In the 11 years we have been with CCA the virtual library has not gotten any easier to navigate. Adding the end of the grading periods, not just semester endings, to the calendar would make keeping track of how far a student is in the curriculum compared to where they need to be much easier.","Having a staff that makes the child feel that they are important.","I don't know.","the service is fine","I wish the gifted program was more about expanding the child's knowledge than loading them down with more work. It is like punishing a child for being intelligent. Also, this year one teacher accused my child of plagiarism because his essay was so well written. When the teacher was confronted she ended up apologizing, but it has made us have less confidence in the professionalism of the staff.","The format for which students with IEP receive their modified materials should be streamlined.  It is confusing that each teacher has their own format as to how to access modified assessments.  Some teachers want called, some have the material on the message board, and unfortunately some teachers have to be reminded consistently that the modified materials are needed.  They should all be accessible in the same format to make it easier for the student and the learning coach.","Our problems have been with the teacher taking a long time to respond to questions then not really answering the question at all. Many times the links to video's in the lessons don't work. The teachers mic sometimes doesn't work and kids miss lessons because they can't hear her (called tech support and they said the problem is with the teachers equipment and they can't do anything about that).Kids are given assignments (math especially) that have no answer keys available for parents or even to the teacher (as stated by her). 3-4 portfolios due at the same time and very long days needed to complete all the work load. My son is supposed to have OT, but only had one for three visits all year. Questions are on work pages and tests that weren't covered yet in lessons or were skipped over until a later unit.","One of my children has an IEP.  It would be more helpful for my student and me if all her modifications were in a central location (modification tool).  Right now, she has to go to several places in order to obtain her modified assessments.  It depends on the teacher what format they use for modifications and I feel it should be in the same format and location for all teachers.  I often have to request modifications, even though they are supposed to be available.  Some of the teachers do not communicate back to me in a timely manner.  Some teachers do not offer feedback on questions that are missed.  I feel that feedback is important so my students can learn from their mistakes.  The curriculum is often based on state testing, instead of a well rounded lesson plan.  This year there has been a lot of issues with audio for several teachers.  We have been unable to understand several live lessons due to the audio problems.  I also feel that there should be stricter rules during live lessons.  I have observed the same students every day disrupting the live lessons, and nothing is ever done about it.  It is distracting and takes away from the lesson for the students that are there to learn.","Unsure.","My son has an IEP. I feel the portfolios and some of the teachers are pretty tough on him. Also when they grade his short answer questions. They need to remember his disability.","More special help for learning support\n","Be less bureaucratic and more flexible.  Understand that some students need the freedom and flexibility to do more.\nRespond to parents' inquiries.  \nDeal with teachers who lie to students.","Its services meet our current needs.","im am fine how it is","There is not really anything I can think of right now.\n","everything is fine","I'm satisfied with it now.","It would help to have evening tutoring available.\nShe is spending it seems an average of 8-9 hrs/day and not keeping up or truly absorbing anything.  Everything is a rush to do to keep up and not be actually learned.  Since starting here, she has no time to herself and is frustrated.  She wants to succeed but is overwhelmed with the volume of work.","Offer more advanced classes to elementary students.","more phone calls","they are always helping so I have no problems","unsure","Just continue to give my child the support she needs as well as I do","Everything is going well right now","I am really happy with the school so far.  I look forward to having two children enrolled next year.","There needs to be more opportunities for extra school work for kids working ahead.  Like maybe advanced reading groups instead of just groups for kids having trouble or science and social studies live lessons.  The live lessons are great.  Also, some of the teachers use the technology available to them to the best of their ability, Ms. Wissinger and Ms. Grafton for two examples that I have had experience.  Other teachers just talk in the background and I feel that they should all incorporate technology into their lessons.  I've seen both types of lessons and I know that my children take more away from the more interactive ones.  My phone is 814-354-2325 if you would like to talk further about any of this.","so far i have no issues.","Keep up the great work!","Keep doing what you have been doing!","I find the level of care, professionalism, and curriculum to be right where it needs to be.","I am satisfied with everything about CCA","Keep up the good work! You are doing a fantastic job.","Don't know","I cannot think of any way you could.","Create more socialization for high school students in our area","Have more classes available online.","currently satisfied","Have more field trips available in our area. Have the teachers more involved with students. Sticking to the curriculum in live lessons. Also the books and parent guide books going along with the guide exactly.","we are new and just getting adjusted having wifi any where right in the lap top would be efficient\n","I have been very happy!!!!","I can't think of anything that you don't already do. I like the teachers and their ability to care about the students","Nothing at this time that I can think of","Administrators need to respond in a timely manner. The teachers all respond very quickly, but administrators take forever. Perhaps they are overloaded, and this issue needs to be addressed?","Improve the curriculum.  Common core math thus far seems very obtuse at times and uses nomenclature that no one uses in Math.  For example number sentences rather than informing kids they are called equations.  Reading curriculum doesn't stress phonics enough but rather mixes phonics with too many sight words.  Reading also focuses on vocabulary words that are far beyond the scope of what a typical K-student can handle.  Amazing words, rather than actually teaching words the kids typically could sound out, spell and would use themselves.  The K-level decodable books are for the most part horribly dull and most of the times aren't really stories, you may as just well have the kids read sentences with the applicable sounds from the lesson.  Some lessons require extensive time and some end up being fairly short, but the lack of balance sometimes makes it difficult to schedule.  I supplement heavily to challenge my child and if she didn't already know how to read well and the like I would be highly dissapointed with much of the reading curriculum in particular and the math to some degree as well.  I hope that something beyond this Pearson common core information is used in the years to come, the curriculum although interesting with the videos and activities I find lacking overall.  Phonics based reading and teaching students where they are, rather than attempting to mix in more advanced \"comprehension\" via amazing words and the like can't be helpful for students in excelling at the fundamentals.  If the curriculum improves I would be completely satisfied, but as it stands much of the Math/Reading information is not structured properly, likely because its attempting to align with common core testing down the road rather than helping children excel and learn terminology that everyone uses and they can easily learn without extraneous information.","Improve the curriculum, move away from common core Math as soon as possible.  Use testing that is more applicable for benchmarking rather than requiring guessing and an extreme amount of time.  Benchmarking assessments are FAR too long.  For this age range it should not be any longer than 20minutes.  Age appropriate testing is very important and tests that require 1 hour or more skew the data and don't follow developmentally appropriate testing standards.  More feedback from a parent/coach would provide better data. For example this years new Math assessment, which was highly innapropriate and did not allow for a child to end the test early when going into material that was far beyond the scope of the educational material.  \n\nAs an asynch student, the curriclum remains the main way we interface with CCA and its seems uneven at best.  At times the materail is very interesting and engaging.  At other times it is convoluted (some of the Math) and not age appropriate.  For example in Kindgergarten last year the students were supposed to do a portfolio on variables and independent variables.  This is beyond ridiculous, given they were still practing their letters at the time.  Overall the curriculum remains my number one frustration with CCA, particularly Math class.  Also projects that require students to engage in 30min activities at this age--are by their nature not appropriate.  I suggest looking at Psychological testing standards for what is developmentally appropriate times per age of the student.  Time and time again class projects are far to time intensive for the young age of the student.","everything is good at this time","Special needs children cannot keep up well in this program.  The gifted program overwhelmed my gifted students with work that they could not keep up with.  Please, make lessons that are consistent across the curriculum and accurate, as well as up to date.  Common core lessons are useless and I have had four students barely pass math now that they changed to this standard. Simple and straightforward would be so much more effective.  Listening to parent input would also be nice.","Language lessons on the website need to be more helpful for us teachers... Too chopped up and very vague ... Maybe more videos. I have not gone to school for this and have no back ground in teaching...very frustrating when she is not understanding and I am not sure how else to explain. I have to go to other websites to find information. Plus the message board...wow...this is a very confusing and complicated space!!! Hard to find information and when you do hard to find it again. Also how do we find the office or tech numbers? I have to keep asking my teacher for them!","Less background noise in LL. An easier to navigate message and information section (impossible to find tech number, have to log out and see it on the screen). More classroom videos, I do not have a teaching degree and am not sure how to present things in a different way than how I was taught. Less worksheets...They are so overwhelming. My daughter takes sometimes 20 mins on one! A parent to parent help area would be good, at times it is very hard and to have encouragement and tips would be helpful. All readers should be printed and sent out, not just on the computer. Plus all handouts. Thank you for listening.","Not sure at this time","I don't really know how to answer this question.","not sure","by having a satellite office in Erie, PA \n","Overall online speed improvements.","Make it easier for us to understand what you are teaching my student.","All is great","I THINK YOU SHOULD ALL KEEP DOING AS YOU ARE. I AM IMPRESSED!!","not sure u can improve on perfection","Nothing for right now!","I am satisfied.","i am very satisfied","More tutoring sessions at multiple times.\nWould prefer if the teachers call more often.  \nNeed CCA live classes in our area for dissection, science experiments, etc.","More teacher contact via email.\n\nI want to be able to use my personal email, NOT CCA.\n\nSomethings need to be easier to find such as FIELD TRIPS (need more of these for teens)\n\nMore teacher contact.","Our experience with CCA has been wonderful, as far as serving us better, well there is always room for improvement in anything that we do but CCA is a place that if you reach out and communicate with the teachers or administrators they will always help out the way they can.","I really can't think of anything at this time","Keep textbooks for all core subjects and use them.  Also, don't overload with projects, labs and portfolios. Keep the basics and keep them strong.","Stay open! :)","Not sure.","We live in probably your least populated area NW PA in Erie. We were never able to connect with the robotics team leaders for online meetings because of the time zone differences and conflicts with Live Lessons. We tried Spanish as an elective but again it was too \"long distant\". Perhaps, since CCA is now pulling things in house and in state maybe you could add Spanish Live Lessons or a hands on Robotics club.","I really dislike the Language Arts Curriculum.  My child becomes very uninterested in it quickly.  The school has served us well.","They need to make up their mind whether Live Lessons are mandatory or not. My child has been in a cyber school environment since K. We have done self paced, virtual classroom and blended programs before coming to CCA. I understand CCA LL were at one time only 15 minutes to half hour long and were supplemental. Now LL are more or less mandatory and are routinely an hour and some have been almost  1 1/2 hrs when students are giving presentations or the topic must be fully covered that day. I don't have a problem with that because my child is in GT. But if the school day is supposed to be 6 hrs, and you add up all the LL for core classes plus LL for JGB, GT Science, art (which was doubled for A semester and none in B), health,and then time for gym, ed tech, Skills for Success,electives, field trips etc.  we come out at 8-9 hours a day and many weeks with a 6th full day to finish daily assignments and portfolios. As we go along the need for flexibility of scheduling and attending mandatory classes will become more of an issue for my child.","Remain open ! &lt;3","Do better job at giving information (at the beginning of the year) on how to get an individualized learning plan for a child as advertised.  For example, my son is a number of grades ahead in math, but he was not allowed to test for math until the mid year benchmarking assessments.  And then because he did not do well on the iready assessment, he is stuck doing math that he is well past and is extremely bored with.  His teacher has been informed he is ahead, but keeps testing him on the current grade level and has no information on moving to more advanced math.  The only class he was able to advance in is reading, even though he is pretty advanced in more subjects especially math.","The help desk is not as good this year. The hours and days that they are available has changed. The skill set does not seem as up to par as it was prior when CCA was part of the national school. Curriculum is concerning too. There used to be text books and corresponding workbooks for all subjects. Technology class is a grave concern. Health with gym is also over emphasized. Foreign language is important but not available at CCA. Technology students in this day and age will automatically pick up as the go. Children today are of the technology era. How well do they communicate with others especially since they are home schooled. How about teaching communication &amp; social interaction etiquette?  Also in our global economy how well will they fit in without knowledge of other languages &amp; cultures?","I think that CCA is doing a wonderful job and I can't think of anything that would make our experience better.","Serves me well already","STOP LYING. BE TRUTHFUL WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE CURRICULUM. TRULY MAKE CHANGES (FOR THE BETTER) AS PROMISED.","I would greatly appreciate it if the field trips were planned in more areas. The person in charge of the southeast region seems to want to keep all the field trips in Philadelphia and rarely plans trips outside the city. While I am in that region those trips take me over an hour to get to. They seem to forget that there are people outside of the city that need trips for their kids to go to. And when I look at the Lehigh Valley area it is the same way. All the trips for that region seem to center closer to Harrisburg which is a two hour trip for us. Maybe those areas need to be divided again to help those of us near the Lehigh Valley have more choses without having to travel hours to get to them.","Dramatically improve the curriculum.  End common core math.  Improve testing to make it more fair and relatable to general goals rather than have it sometimes become trivia, or purposefully convoluted in how the questions are posed.  The curriculum is my number one frustration and the math program sometimes is so poor that it alone has made us consider quitting CCA.  For students who primarily are self-directed the curriculum is 90% of our interface with CCA and what the tests/lessons are unfair and of such poor quality it makes for a very bad experience.  Attempting to teach 4-5 garbage methods such as using number lines to subtract large numbers and many other aspects of the math curr. have angered and frustrated both parent and student.  The math curr. is overly time consuming and wastes massive amounts of time teaching methods that aren't real methods at all but just odd gimmicks that no adult would ever begin to use.  Instead of teaching alternative math methods as conceptual tools, they are taught as an actual method.  No one in their right mind that uses math in life or work would ever use blocks to add 100's, nor number lines to subtract large numbers.  Also many of the test questions are patently unfair, don't give partial credit for answers despite some questions having 3 or more responses.  One partial error gives the student zero points, which is unfair testing.  The student frustration and parent frustration involved with tests that aren't fair and don't accurately measure competence in addition to teaching methodologies that aren't even real methods wastes the students time and prevents them from becoming more adept at proven methods.  If the teachers and school haven't been so great and responsive, we would already have quit CCA due to its inconsistent quailty curriculum, horrible early math curr, and its test and measurements being poorly constructed and sometimes patently unfair.","I would love some outreach materials and a yard sign my child attendsCCA. Last year , the school district we live in sent an officer out to make sure my son still lives here. They do not like paying for kids to attend cyber schools.","Just keep doing what you are. :)","...","CCA is already amazing, maybe add more clubs like art club for high school students. Maybe add national art honors society. I would lower the amount of portfolios because you get alot of overdues because of them. Overall, CCA is amazing! :)","Make the learning programs better. The cartoon animals get boring with my 1st grader. They are cute for kindergarten, but not so much for the older kids","Personalize info/knowledge between student and councilor for after grad\n","helping me with resources for my children since they are special needs after graduation","Make the morning and afternoon classes back to back because having one class in the morning another in the afternoon is sometimes hard to get back into focus or do them both in the afternoon, they just need to be back to back","This is a hard question, I feel that CCA does a great job with serving us.  They answer our questions very promptly, we don't have to wait forever.  If something is wrong, they help the situation immediately.  At this time I don't really have anything to add for CCA to better serve us.","In Elem it was more like \"home school with support\" meaning we could truly work at our own pace, engaging the teacher(s) as needed. In MS and HS it is difficult to work ahead. Lessons and/or assessments are often changed or dropped with little notice. Ideally an entire academic year of micro live lessons and well planned assessments would be available for the student at the start of the school year.","Teachers could be more responsive to emails.  Many teachers are great, but every year, there are a certain amount of teachers that do not respond to my emails.  It makes me feel as if they do not care about my concerns, questions, etc...   Several times this year, we have had difficulty receiving modified assignments from certain teachers as per my daughters IEP.  All modifications should be located in the message board across all classes.","My only concern is that the curriculum has felt very fast paced this year and my children have had a very hard time keeping up with their classmates. I think that if the curriculum was slowed down a bit, it wouldn't feel so overwhelming. It'll give children more time to also absorb the information that they are learning.","some teachers are very good with communication some are not.","Respond to webmails and answer questions instead of ignoring concerns.","Have more opportunities available for the kids to have socialization!","I'd like the site and resources to be a little more intuitive next year.","My son s in alarm because it says he hasn't been in touch with the teacher , but he says she is to call him and she hasn't yet  , why is it his fault , CONTACT ......","Physical learning coach guides for all subjects.","Your 12th grade English and American Government classes are more like a 2nd year College class.

My kindergarten was in the same sign language class as my 4th grader and at some points were over her head. Home life again my kindergarten was in with older kids and the projects were not at her level. Spanish for her also was an issue. The lessons were just watching videos I could go and get on you tube. I wasn't pleased with any of the electives for her. For my fourth grader they all worked out fine except for math club. Math club was at the same time live lessons were. She could not miss what was going on in her own math class. I tried asking the math leader about this and I never received a reply.","I am completely satisfied.","I am hoping the live lessons for the new school year, actually go along with what my kid is learning that day. Every time my kids would go to a live lesson, it was never what they were learning for that day. I am hoping  the curriculum the curriculum for math and lang. art is a lot different. My kids and I did not like the curriculum.","I feel very well served by this school","I wish I didnt have to go back to the home screen to switch between my kids when looking at schedules or submitting work.","could provide internet on laptops.","continue with excellent service","CCA is great. They are always looking and creating new ways of learning for my children. They tailor lessons to the students and the teachers are always there to help out the child. All CCA can do is keep going on the path they are. CCA is always growing in the education field.","The only problem really is the common core, I think that should be changed.","Overall the teachers are so phenomenal and supportive, however, every once and a while in the time that we have been with the school, we have a teacher who does not readily update their message board with their Live Lessons on a daily basis, the same teacher normally does not communicate schedules, changes to curriculum, clear expectations on due dates, and expectations on projects.  One of the wonderful things about CCA is the flexibility and freedom to move at your own pace, but occasionally it seems like there are teachers who penalize students who want to be able to move a little quicker because they understand the material.  If the message boards had clear instructions and expectations for every course, this would be wonderful.  I have one student who thrives with Live Lesson interaction and enjoys the interaction and this school is perfect for him.  I have one student who becomes frustrated with Live Lessons because she wants to be able to move on once she gets the material, I want the school to be perfect for her, too.  Clear communication through webmails and message boards would make this possible.","I would love to be able to cyber school him through CCA and have him attend the Monroe County Technical School part time so he can learn the skills he is interested in for the future. I was hoping he could do his academic work at home and electives like welding, graphic design or mechanics at MCTI.","CCA is okay at the momment","My child's IEP services have not been implemented properly this year. This problem has led to more challenges and problems for my child.  The flexibility was a good thing when we first started with CCA, but has become a problem. My child feels he doesn't have to follow a schedule or complete assignment in a timely manner because of the flexibility he has be given.","CCA has great teachers. We have always loved them, however, some of my student's live lessons are an HOUR long....and that doesn't count having to go back into the lesson, do practice problems as well as a quick check, a quiz, or even a test. It is way too time-consuming and burdensome.  The curriculum moves at breakneck speed and while I keep hearing talk of all new curriculum that will slow the pace, I have no confidence that it will be enough. My student has always found CCA's curriculum extremely boring, and I completely understand why. It is quite dull and uncreative. Again, I understand that they're getting all new curriculum next year, but I have great doubts that it will suddenly become engaging and fascinating.  At this point, I am very uncertain as to what I'm going to do with my student next school year.","We would like to see more local field trips.","I am happy with everything.","IEP modifications for the Learning Processing Students to be kept up to date during the school year. The other supports to be kept in place too.","Like it the way it us","Because of the non existence of social atmosphere, I feel it is important to re-establish the activity clubs to the way they were.  The new way is just not working.  There were more opportunities for the children to intermingle with the friends they had made over the years.  There are not as many opportunities in some districts as there are in others.  I also feel that English and Business courses are extremely hard for ninth grade students.  I am a college graduate.  I understand that it is important for the students to excel.  I find it difficult to understand why a teacher needs to apologize to students for the difficulty of a lesson.  Words such as, I promise this portfolio won't be anywhere as hard as the last one, should not have to be heard.  It is discouraging to the student and stressful to the learning coach.  It also put a negative spin on the class right off the start.  One more issue I have is the live lessons.  This is our fourth year.  We do not attend live lessons.  It is too distracting trying to pay attention with the sidebar running and the kids constantly posting nonsense back and forth to each other.  Teachers need to teach their lessons, period.  If there are questions, pull up the sidebar, answer the questions and then continue on with class.\n","I think they are doing a great job right now with my daughter health concerns.","Cant think of anything at the moment.","CCA has always responded quickly whenever a question has come up.","I really cannot think of a better way. CCA is very accessible and every time I have needed something or a question answered I receive it in a timely manner.","Keep supporting my family and helping us get to our goals","By getting rid of state testing and benchmarks. I am not fond of either one of them. I personally don't  believe in state testing, but since opting out is such an issue with CCA, its just ridiculous","i feel that cca is helping us and i feel that they giving us everthing we need to leaning im so happy with cca","More tutoring sessions and  more communation with the parents of a high schooler","N/A","I think CCA is great.","Please bring back the STEM and STEAM activities to Pittsburgh. We miss Kurt Amen and Shephanie Gofourth very much. These activities helped teach working together in groups. Field trips cannot do that, and it is an area severely lacking in the cyber environment. In the corporate world, we work in groups all the time. This must be taught.","I know of other online schools that offer a free WI-FI jetpack to students that can't get internet where they live or can't afford it {you can only use it for school but it helps tremendously}. We live far out of town and cable doesn't come up this far so we had to bundle DIRECTV with AT&amp;T wireless to get enough GB's for video-streaming live sessions and that is pretty expensive. Just something you might want to look into.","Live up what you advertise. This is not a flexible program, teachers do not contact you. The focus is standardized testing. All that was promised to be at orientation two years never happened.\nReally disappointed .\n","to me they don't need to I think there good just the way they are","I feel very well served.","Keep doing what you are doing. Excellent program. Need sports :(","I think it is a good program for what it is.  My daughter is in Kindergarten and I think it worked well for her because she already had a lot of the curriculum in preschool.   I'm not sure how I feel about how this will work going forward.  I was really excited about the Spanish option however, I don't know how realistic that curriculum is.  My daughter struggled a little with the content as I don't speak spanish and Youtube vidoes were not always the most clear.  I got her a virtual Spanish instructor 3 times a week for 30 minutes to actually talk to her and she is quickly picking up the content.  I'm thinking that the Youtube vidoes are not the best mechanism for learning.   There is something missing in that.  I also think you need a better assessment process","I feel the initial meeting i attended when deciding whether to go with CCA was very misleading for the reasons I've already stated throughout this survey.  Also, please make sure that your newer teachers are up to date of all things curriculum/system related.","CCA is a great school and they already go above and beyond what I had expected of them.  So for me, I think if they simply keep doing what they're doing, that would be great!","If communication (teachers) would be more frequent, it would be very beneficial.  Especially at the High School level.  There are times my daughter has not received response for over a week and she actually had to follow up in order to retrieve the answers to her questions.","Im not sure. Ive been pleased with how things are run and structured.","Make the planner easier to reschedule!","We are excited for next year and \"meeting\" EDIO and seeing the curriculum changes the teachers have eluded to.","CCA is great. Much better then the public schools in my area.","n/a","The 504 program need a continuous facilitator. My daughter has gone without services for much of the school year, and things fell thru cracks as employees leading the 504 changed. Also, being sure the kids eligible for things such as OT are ACTUALLY receiving the service.","They are great would just would like more hand on having help on classes that my children are weak on like math. Would also like to get more information on college course that can be taken up for a 9th grader and how does that go.","I think the school is doing a fine job.","Basically, stop with so many portfolios.","Not sure","CCA has done well in addressing any concerns that a parent could possibly have. The school offers so much helpful information through it's emails and connections to other learning coaches and parents. I would only suggest that portfolio assignments are not given as part of a lesson  so that  students are able to continue moving forward with their lessons.","I think everything about cca is great I only recommend keep up the good job you are doing . Cca is a great school, I would recommend it to anyone.","I don't think you can improve upon excellence! This is my child's 4th year at CCA and we are extremely satisfied with her educational experience!","Unsure","You already did a fantastic job! We love CCA!","By having a meet and great for students (the same grade/age) in their local areas.","More Live lessons for parents","I think just more supply and have more family event that would be good","noting realy","more structured learning","Have teachers contact me when I need them too.","making field trips more accessible.","The only obstacle that we have encountered while at CCA is the isolation and lack of socialization. We live in the country and my daughter has no siblings that live at home any longer. The first year, the isolation was a welcomed thing, now, after 3 years, it has become an issue. Our daughter gets lonely and has developed social anxiety. She recognizes the issue and is working hard to find activities to involve herself in. We participate as much as possible in school related activities, but the same students do not consistently turn out for the events. This makes it difficult to form relationships. She is adding more andmore local activities into her schedule like; candy Striping, dog training, church events and is now old enough to pursue a part time job. I believe that CCA is aware of the issues that cyber schooling can create socially for children and I appreciate the efforts that CCA is doing to offer opportunities for their students.","I wish the teachers of the middle school and high school would do a better job of helping the students take notes during class.  Handouts/printouts of notes with blanks is a great way to get participation from the students and allows them to have notes to study for this test.  Too many teachers give open ended questions as study guides and no actual notes.  Students at this age need guidance in taking notes and handouts with blanks is highly appropriate:  they encourage participation and give specific materials that need to be studied for tests.  This is my biggest complaint (as a teacher with a master's degree in science education)... these kids NEED to know what to study and these notes would really benefit them - in all classes.  Just going to class and listening to a teacher and watching what is on the screen without any guidance/help to take notes does not keep their attention or give them an incentive to write anything down.  PLEASE... give them something to help them take notes.","I hope CCA will have more field trips that involved teachers around my area. We live in northwest PA. Even though we do have field trips but most of the one we want to attend are not in our area.","I am extremely satisfied.  I am hoping for an even better year with the new LMS system and curriculum designed by our own teachers!","CCA has been great and I have no complaints with CCA","The monthly family mentor call is a bit annoying. I am the type that will reach out if i need anything, maybe give the option to get an update via webmail.","no suggestion","Unsure...","Nothing. Everything is great!","They are great how they are.","CCA already did an awesome job.","The Special Education Department was a bit slow with my son's IEP implementation and getting things set up for a kindergartener when they were aware that he had an IFSP before enrolling. Once the elementary administrators were aware, though, they worked hard to get things straightened out and the Special Education Director personally called to let me know she would have everything taken care of. I think just that initial enrollment for incoming kindergarten students with special education needs could be better.","They are doing great now!","I'd like to see one software program for all courses. I don't like having to flip flop from connexus to clever to Schoology, to canvas, etc. Also, I like the old LA and Math quick checks better than this interim program that has errors.  It would also be nice if elementary had live lessons for science, health, and social studies at least once a week like brick and mortar. Would also prefer less portfolios that require learning coaches input. It's time consuming on our part, especially when we have multiple children in the program along with babies to care for. Would love to see more teacher guidance for complicated experiments.","?","I believe the changes planned for next year will be helpful.\nIt will be beneficial to have modified tests, quizzes, etc. more easy to access, instead of having to go to message boards to find them. \nIt would be helpful if accessing modified tests, etc. and signing into live lessons were the same for all classes.\nIt would be helpful if all recorded lessons were titled, so it would be easier to access needed lessons.\n","I do not feel CCA can do anything else to serve me better. CCA has done everything and more that I could have ever expected.","I would love for the sound to be clearer in the virt class rooms  its soo muffled it take s alot of effort to understand the teacher even after  getting tech help","Understand that each student is different and learns differently. I feel my 5th grader was put in a for all box. He is clearly a different learner. The Conexus systems has many errors which holds up the learning process. So assignments are confusing for my students as well as very long and time consuming. I am a college student mom and my 5th grader assignments were long than my own college assignments.  kids should be kids.","Not sure\n","None; CCA is wonderful.\n","Make it easier to opt of certain subjects, like art.","No suggestions at this time.","give more choices for elective classes in high school.","Make all of the subjects have the ability to read the book to them.  With his eye tics it causes him trouble","Start an online College.","I would like to see vocational schools allowed in the high school curriculum.","I was wondering if the teachers in the high school could monitor their chat pod better. My daughter was involved in some unneccessary conversations with boys this year and teachers were said to be in the room at the time.","I'm hoping it is easier to find things on the new platform .","Overall it has been a very pleasant journey for our whole family. Although this year we are not very happy with 5th grade LA unit tests &amp; quizzes. These tests were very lengthy and unfair when it came to having multiple questions asked in one, and a partial credit was not granted. I found this to be frustrating for students, learning coaches and teachers as well.  I'm hoping this will be fixed in the coming school year.","Teachers give more options of more work for better grades","Everything is as it should be!","I think CCA is doing a great job!","I am happy with CCA and anxious for the new system.","I would like it if my daughters teachers would call so their wasn't an alarm because we don't always have a phone.","More Parent books. I liked the classes better before all the new changes. It was difficult getting started and finding my materials.","more field trips in our local area for to be able to participate in more often","Better, more committed and passionate and interested teachers.   (i.e., several times it takes days and days for several teachers to respond to one email - uncalled for.  For others, they are not very interested in what they are teaching and it obvious, while others love what they do.  It's hit or miss.  It also influences how the kid feels about the class.)  Also, better customer service would be nice.  More flexibility would be handy.","I cant think of any thing","The math is a struggle.","I'm very involved in my childs education I a problem comes up I expedite immediately.","I worry that although my child made the transition to CCA from a traditional school setting without too much trouble, that the transition back to a more traditional setting at a 4 year college or university may be more difficult.  Whatever CCA can do to help make sure my child is prepared and ready to make that transition when the time comes would be appreciated.  Specifically, I am concerned that my child is not developing note taking and studying skills and is getting used to taking tests with no specific time limit and completing projects with no specific deadline.  I realize it is probably hard for a cyber school to address some of these issues, but I did have one suggestion.  The portfolio projects that appear on the lesson plans usually create a situation where my child continually falls behind in classes for that subject because more time is spent on the portfolio and it is not possible currently to work ahead in that subject until the portfolio is completed.  What if some of the portfolios could be treated like more traditional research projects or term papers where they are assigned and due by a certain date, but at the same time it would have to be possible to continue working in that subject while the portfolio is being worked on?  Don't know if this could ever be made possible, but it would give students an additional taste of what working to a deadline is like, besides the end of semester deadlines that already exist.  Thanks!","better teacher communication for my seventh grader","I wish there was a way to learn with all of my children more. When we were homeschooling, we did a lot of projects that involved multiple grades and all of my kids could participate. I realize that it is very hard to have this built into any non-homeschooling curriculum. However, it is what we struggle with the most. We currently have three children enrolled (would be 4 next year if one had not decided to switch to the local school district). The most difficult part of CCA for us is 3 completely separate school days. All work has to be done separately and that can sometimes lead to a very long day.","THE CENTER NEEDLE TO BE MORE HELPER","I would like to receive an email with which opportunities are available to each of my children at their grade level. I just learned about the gifted programs, through my own outside search, where CCA came up. I wish I knew about this sooner. My 8th grader would have done really well with it.","I have no problems so far I am happy with CCA.","i love how everyone is constantly in contact with me about my student. I love that we can all be on the same page with what i want her to learn.","I have yet to be disappointed by CCA. The school usually improves itself before any issues arise.","Sometimes it is difficult to get phone calls or webmail messages responded to.  It would be helpful to get a quicker response even if the message is simply that they are looking into the issue and it will take longer to find a solution.","More science related field trips in my area.  This year, we traveled at least two hours for all field trips.  Our favorites are science related.","No suggestions.","Not sure yet.","Offer more flexibility with the schedule when traveling. For instants, my daughter tried to work ahead since we were going on vacation, but one of her teachers were in the scheduler and added more lessons two days before we had to leave. Now instead of being caught up her schedule looks like she is behind. Also, she was following mass that was on her planner but her teacher told us she was behind in math Since he was on a different lesson in life lessons. We dont understand how this happened because she was following her schedule.","They are already do a great job to serve me!","I am satisfied with the service.","More one on one personalizing of curriculum for children with learning issues.","I feel that CCA is perfect the way it is.","CCA is great!!  I have nothing negative to say about them.  Everyone has been super helpful and nice.","Honestly, you all have gone above and beyond","just keep doing what your doing","more opportunity to meet teachers","Satisfied with everything right now","The amount of portfolios and test questions can get a bit overwhelming. Maybe less and less common core questions that try and trick the student.","A better more central area for teachers messages The current independent webpages and bulletin boards are VERY confusing, it needs to be in one place with links to each. Better method for field trip options (and the way the state is divided up is weird making it hard to pick what to attend).","OUTSTANDINGLY DONE NONE AND ALL THANK YOU THANK YOU","CCA  has already done it!  You listened to the problems with this years lessons and have already changed things for next year!

Also, CCA was light on the course materials. I want actual books plz not online resources. If next years curriculum is as HORRIBLE as this years I will withdraw my children.

An upgrade to newer ones would be nice.","stop giving these kids school work that I never had until I was in a higher grade","Not all but some of the teachers and the upper grades are not as friendly as they are in the Elementary grades.. I have had teachers that don't even get back to me. So they definitely don't get back to my child. We left brick-and-mortar due to unfriendly teachers. And now we are experiencing the same at times. When we join CCA all of the staff were friendly and caring. I would like to see it go back to that way again. It has not been like that the last few years","This year I think I was more disappointed because I really needed more help getting my child to care about her grades. I was being told it's senioritis, which is fine to an extent, but she is failing two classes and not working on them at all. Even though she does not need them to graduate I feel at a loss in getting help trying to tell her how it is going to hurt her in the future if she decides to go to school. Having F's on your transcript is not a positive thing. She is fully capable of doing the work, just needed more of a stern voice from someone else other than her parents.","Decrease the amount of portfolio's and the way they line up. My students have all portfolios sue the same week and even day sometimes. 5th Gifted had 2 science portfolios every unit, when some units are only 6 classes long. That's too much busy work. The long term projects are great because they are broken up, but it's too much. Also, the lesson plan rarely gives time to complete a portfolio. Kids do an entire lesson and then are told to add more time to work on the portfolio. Only the long term projects have a few classes built into them. I do feel that this curriculum is harder than most and I wish it was a little less intensive for elementary students. Also 5th grade art was only tests and no portfolios. Art shouldn't have tests unless HS art history. It should be able the projects. We never had tests when I was younger until college.","n/a","Mobile app","For middle school students, it would be helpful if the teachers would reach out to students who can improve in grades because sometimes they are too scared to ask themselves.

The only complaint my family has is the math curriculum. It doesn't fit the grade levels. Our 2nd graders should not have to learn some of this this early. I personally think that the common core should be revised or taken away. It makes learning math so much more difficult and takes the fun out of learning math. Our kids, friends of our kids, and kids in our family that are in CCA all agree with this. Please consider revising, taking away, or just flat out change the math curriculum . It is easier said I know but it is taking the fun out of math for the kids and that is not good. It frustrates some of the kids and makes it a lot harder to learn the things they need to know.","Unfortunately, the decision has already been made to leave CCA since we cannot get proper cooperation from staff members to accomodate children with behavioral issues.  To further prove the point, my child has shown improvement over the past 5-6 months but we still get the staff to lift a judgement against my child that would allow for longer school days.  When we attended a different cyber school, assistance was provided through a resource from the cyber school.  I asked for the same type of service through CCA but was never given that resource or service.  I understand that CCA is not responsible for offering a social piece to their education but it should be a consideration to all that it tries to offer.  Socialization is an important tool to teach children.  Having the use of Centers help in that area. Therefore, giving students an opportunity to learning with their peers can really change the learning atmosphere of students.","The web site is not user friendly.

It was hard to get a hold of those teachers.  They did not seem that interested in getting back quickly.","Nothing","Everything is great could not ask for anything better\n","Cant think of any improvements.","The field trips have been fantastic, but would be nice if they had more social, non-structured events outside of the school day that would foster socialization between both the students and adults.  Another idea would be to start regional PTO's so that parent volunteers can create these type of events, and raise money for the school or other non-profits.","Nothing really. I'm glad for our years with CCA. I am very pro school choice and always will be. It's good to know we can always return to CCA if we need.","I think CCA is perfect the way it is. If there are concerns, they get addressed promptly. The teachers are amazing. I talk to everyone about CCA and recommend it highly.",".","The CCA program/school is great as is.  We are trying to get back into the public school system.  If it doesn't work we will definitely be back  My child is entering 9th grade at a new school","Consistency among teachers.","Nothing, I feel everything is fine.","Upgraded laptops that process faster as it's very frustrating.  Every program needed runs super slow, and videos take forever to load and play, which adds more aggravation to students that have academic issues already.","they are doing the best they can","Our family is not very demanding. When we've needed to reach out to CCA staff, whether it be the teachers, the administrators or the IT desk, our issues were taken care of promptly and professionally. I have colleagues with children in brick and mortar schools and feel the curriculum at CCA surpasses that of these other local schools. We have seen improvements over the years at CCA with the live lessons increasing and the field trip offerings. We cannot ask for more. Keep up the great work! Our family is with you through graduation.","If anything I would ask for more input on what courses students should take to head them in the direction of there career choice .","N/A","My family has appreciated the field trips listed, although we have not taken advantage of any due to our schedule and finances. I would like to see more free field trips especially for the older kids.\n\nAt the tutoring facilities enable each student meeting with a tutor a quiet room to be taught in.  My daughter had been tutored one time and she couldn't concentrate well on the tutor's help due to the distractions of other kids and noise around her.","I think the school does VOLUMES more that brick and mortal cannot/will not. I know there are other things, like afterschool tutoring, that are available. The limitation is time on our part. It extends the school day way too long.","This past year my family took a vacation to Florida. We were able to use the scheduler for our 3rd grader to mark our vacation days with no school being scheduled on those days, which enabled us to get all the school done that we needed ahead of time, and know that we were still on track to finish the school on time. However, we were unable to use the scheduler for our 10th grade student so she had to work ahead on her own, which made it somewhat difficult for her and her teachers. It would be awesome if parents could use the scheduler for high school students just to schedule vacation days into the calendar! Thanks for considering this suggestion! It would really make taking vacation days easier.","I would like to see more hands-on classroom time at the Andreas office. He went there for a few science lab lessons and they were great. Also making more field trips on a Friday when the kids have more free time would be nice.","Special Education case manager should return emails and answer simple questions regarding IEP.","Assist curriculum difficulty, do less portfolios, have more electives options","Not sure\n","n/a","I am quite pleased with the school.","it needs to be easier for my student to be considered \"on track\" especially when she is not behind and is carrying a 90% overall average.","I thought the workload was a little cumbersome at times, especially for my younger students who have not been in a traditional school setting before.","All is well","The high school teachers could communicate better.","More events and contact with the school in my region.","Better interaction with students from the school counselors as far as making sure the students are taking the appropriate number of classes to make sure they are on track to graduate on time without having to overload their schedules to make sure they are on track.","Be more hands on with Special needs, IEP, 504 plans and be train the teachers.","I can't think of any way","Better communication with teachers \nAll teacher should send that weeks schedule of lesson first thing Monday morning","Change the curriculum! I already know you are and I am grateful for that. I hope that the people who you chose to write the curriculum  are qualified.  My 'student' got tired of alllllll the constant mistakes. She gave up and emailed the company directly.\nI do think you have some teachers who are not as qualified as they should be to work for the quality of CCA.  A teacher who is pompous and critical may be acceptable in the college arena, but not the elementary level. Please do NOT assume that the parent is the one doing the educating along with you. Sometimes it is the grandparent and sometimes a local teacher is hired to supervise several students at one time for parents who have to work but the parent does not want them in B &amp; M. While I realize that PA. is a big state but i was hoping to see the van up in the NE part of the state. It's nice to see that you have the capability to show live science classes, but not when they are not available to all.",".","I truly believe that CCA is one of the best cyber school programs out there. As stated on a previous slide, the current curriculum has had some frustrations, particularly 3rd grade Math and Language Arts. I have not forced my son to work as independently as needed because some of the questions are worded so difficultly that sometimes even I struggle with knowing exactly what is being asked. I know that the new LMS and curriculum will eliminate many of those frustrations, and I am very excited about next year. As a CCA family mentor, I am looking forward to what is in store for CCA. I think only great things are on the horizon!!","Im happy with cca","with having several teachers and support staff involved with my child, it would be nice if everyone was on the same page as far as what is expected for work assignments and classes attended. Learning support and teachers need better communication and when teachers are assigned to a student, they do not need to be moved around and changed - this is what happened to us four separate times last year and it was confusing as to what work was required and what wasn't.","Train the teachers not to play favorites in their virtual classroom. My daughter's teacher calls on the same children over and over again. She also ignores it when this child/ren get up and leave the room or shove toys into the camera, but if anyone else does it, she reprimands them. This is very frustrating for me as a parent to sit by and watch.","Si pudieran poner las clases intrucctivas para los padres en su idioma, ejemplo yo habl espaol .Ser un placer poder entenderlas ,pero estoy realmente agradecida por su buen trabajo","test","N/A","Continue in the direction they are going. Keep family first. Listen to what we have to say and what our children need. Put our kids needs first.  You do a terrific job of this now and I want to see this continue.","CCA has been great for the whole family. There's not anything else I can think of at this time on how CCA can serve me better. Everything is good on my behalf.\nThank you!","There is nothing I can think of right now.","If CCA could better coordinate across the disciplines (e.g., math, science, history, etc.)  regarding when essays/portfolios and tests occur, it would be helpful.  Often these are all due at one time.  IT becomes very overwhelming for my child.","N/A","No way. I find that everything CCA is doing is improving my child's education.","unsure","I don't like the school system program it's too confusing to the students. There has to be a better way for them navigate through everything.","My daughter is graduating this year.  The only issue we had with any subjects this year was in the personal finance, 1/2 year course for seniors. CCA needs to be careful when selecting speakers for student courses.  I think these last 2 years have shown the majority of Americans that \"wealth\" is not synonymous with \"intelligence, ethics or tactfulness\".  The information given to students needs to be factual and without bias. Occasional monitoring may not be a bad idea.","Making it easier to find the information I need when using the Help Icon or searching other resources on Connexus, or whichever system they will be using next year.  Currently, information is so sub-categorized it can be difficult to know under which category is the info you need, and using search terms does not always return relevant links.","They already do a great job!","a mobile phone app would be great","At this point we are unable to think of anything. We are extremely satisfied with CCA.","There is an \"Unofficial\" CCA parent/learning coach page on Facebook that is poorly representing/misrepresenting CCA with biased postings. I think this Facebook group should be disband or it should not have CCA in the name of the facebook group. When I complained to the administrator of this group, Kris Hardy, about the bias treatment of students that was happening on the page and that it poorly represented CCA, she told me, \"The group is called 'Unofficial CCA' and if I didn't like how she chose to run the group I should leave and join the Official CCA Facebook group!\" I don't think her remarks represent what CCA stands for, but, others might?","No problems !","Not sure at this time. He has one more year to go; keep encouraging  him.","We live in an area with very poor cell phone service.  If someone from CCA calls &amp; I miss the call, it is very costly for me to call them back from my landline since the calls are generally to the Harrisburg area.  I don't really know how you could fix that.  :-(  More services for the students in the Pittsburgh area.  I've noticed that the Mentoring sessions have all been too far away to participate in.","My students (4th and 6th grade) would like to be involved in a Lego Robotics club and there is nothing available at that age. I think it would be great to have a team meet once a week in Harrisburg and compete. More in-person clubs at the new building would be a great idea.","The cyber school is great! Just think some of the curriculum is kinda hard for the kids at times.","Language in lessons should reflect the child's ability to understand and process the meaning of the lesson. If a child is on a kindergarten grade reading level they will not understand a 1,2,3,4, even high school reading level material and i did face that this yr. the school did look into it and made some changes for students. Kudos to the school.","It's good the way it is","nothing they are doing great","More direct contact with teachers.","By continuing what they are doing!","It would be helpful at the High school level if the students were able to speak more within the class, but overall I'm very satisfied.","More  communication with 504 staff.","I would like to simplify the program to make it easier to find how to do things.","teacher can be more flexible, I am disabled and have a lot of appointments so I miss things. I would of liked her counselor to have provide dates, time, and places she cold of taken her SAT testing. My daughter missed early testing cause I didn't have time to do this due to the fact they didn't always answer at Altoona Area High School. Plus it would be nice to have something more than 2 hr. away for my daughter to attend about colleges and the next step. The Career Exploration Pilot was hard to make it for us due to the fact nothing after 2 and closes one to us was at the Williamsport office. With my doctor appointments already schedule for that month and it being so far away, she never got the chance to go but wanted to. She knows what she wants to do after school but needs help finding the steps to get there.","We are very happy with CCA, the teachers have been very helpful during any times of difficulty and have proven to alert me as a learning coach when my student is slacking in her live lessons.  Everyone involved has made this decision to allow our daughter to enroll in cyber school an easy one to continue.","Administrators need to communicate more.  Many times I feel as if I find stuff out after the fact or through pieces I hear from teachers or other parents.  Administration appears to not know what teachers and caretakers/learning coaches are struggling with/deal with/have concerns about.  There does not appear to be any accountability for when issues arise and concerns are brought to the attention of administration.","I'm satisfied with cca \n","There is nothing at this time.  The new EDIO system is so exciting and I can't wait to use it.","N/A","work on that whole double test for students in special ed classes during the benchmark testing times. Ask Mr. Flurrie for further clarification as I spoke with him about it.","We are hoping that the curriculum chances next year will be an improvement and not a problem. Am concerned that rewritten curriculum will have problems, errors or be 'dumbed down.' Hope not!","Traveling to test is an issue and availability of communicating with the teachers\n","Keep the Connexus program","I wish CCA had a Christian base classes or could talk bible studies.","I dont have a recommendations at this time.","Talk more with the parents.

Maybe provide one hour chat for students and a volunteer parent/parents to oversee (monitor) and make sure chatroom is safe and respectful.","Have an office closer to York.\n","I wish that there were other things to do when it comes to experiments in science. I would like to have coding programs for my son.  I wish there were more opportunities that were closer to our home.  I wish that the school would put more effort into extra activities in areas that are closer to home.  Maybe each area where there is a family mentor have something set up and allow all families to be involved if they want to for socialization.","n/a","I can't think of anything.","I think the teachers should stick to MS Word and not use things like Google drive since they don't work.   Snap chat is cute, but I think it is in appropriate here.   One teacher uses it to make videos and it changes her voice so that you can hardly understand her.   These are high school kids, not kindergartners! \n","Well the school is awesome. It has helpful staff. I would love for more one on one interaction with teacher student relationship. I know that might be to much to ask for but my son would love that alot. Or more chats with class mates and having a day of online fun. A day where they can all talk about hobbies and likes it dislikes. It would make the children happier and friendly with one another. I'm not saying they aren't but it would let them understand their classmate.","You can't - this has truly been one of the best choices I have ever made. Enrolling my son in CCA was a life-saver.","I feel like CCA already offers all that is necessary for us to further our student's education.  Whenever we have a question there is always a prompt and friendly response.","nothing","There has been too much turnover this year in particular with our son's Language Arts class. He has had four different teachers due to some transitioning of teachers in and out of the school, and the consistency of teaching and the interruptions have been difficult. \n\nNext year will be our son's last year of middle school at CCA. I have been asking for the past two years for more foreign language and music classes to be made available. The music course was one of the reasons we initially chose CCA, but it has been unavailable the past two years. Our son has already taken all available Spanish classes at the middle school level. More electives would be appreciated.","From what I understand, measures are in place for next year to change the curriculum.  There are some portfolios that seem ridiculous and time consuming--which makes me wish there was more quality not quantity.  Also feel that students are almost discouraged to attend live lessons because there still is a LOT of content in the core subjects to do afterward on the planner.  Hoping next year ALL live lessons actually pertain to the subject on the students planner for the day so as not to have so much work.","At this point there is nothing I can think of. Thank you CCA for you patients and overwhelming help!","From my experience, there really isn't anything stands out at this point, other that getting rid of Common Core and going back to Traditional.","Take a better look at the Accounting course. The curriculum was confusing to staff and students. A lot of frustration was had, I believe unnecessarily.","no comment","The curriculum needs improvement, bring college in high school again.","they are doing the best that can do to help my son with his classes","To realize not all children are comfortable contacting teachers, especially when they were bullied. I dont agree with the alarm status for this reason","CCA has been wonderful for my child and I can't think of anyways to improve it.","Everything is great","Every year we encounter different lists of courses available for next year's scheduling that contradict each other. It gets frustrating.\nPlease be more careful about your text books and curriculum selections. We often find pretty offensive stuff in there. Is it really the place of school to engage in 'social engineering'?\nTemporary zeroes are an absolute ludicrous idiotic policy and idea all across the board. They are ALWAYS a negative impact for us, and finally we simply ignore them as useless and stupid. Either my student gets depressed because her grade suddenly dropped for no reason, or she wonders if her hard earned grades are even hers to keep. She says \"Well, I can see that if I just don't do this assignment, I'll still have a B instead of my A that they took\". She also says, \"Gee, if they want to drop my grade to show me what it will look like if I don't turn work in, then why don't they show me what it will look like if I turn everything in and get mostly As? Because that's a true reflection of reality.\"  Have I made myself clear?","This school is awesome and the teachers are doing an excellent job. I'm not sure if you could serve us any better.","N/A","N/A","Honestly, I can't think of anything. Highly satisfied all around","I think CCA is doing a great job with the kids education.","Making it easier to contact teachers when the student has a question or issue.  This does not mean the teachers are not contacting students, but that sometimes there is a time wait before they can get in touch with a student.","I would like  a forum to be able to meet and greet with other parents in my kids class and get some ideas on how they overcame certain obstacles or celebrated in certain victories. I think that sometimes teachers and parents can bring a biased perspective because of their experience but we can always get the teachers or learning coaches perspective but not so much another parent who may be able to know exactly what the other parent is experiencing and provide a helpful solution.","Nothing that I can think of right now","Just keep helping Dustin so he can graduate in a few years. And keep working with me and CYS ,so that we can minimize the ex-husband/ stepdad problem.","don't think there is anything","It would be nice if the local parent partner was better at responding and helping out.","CCA has been an extraordinary alternative to schooling for my child for the past four years. I do not think I would change anything about CCA.","na","?","There was only one face-to-face parent/administration meeting this academic year.  It would have been helpful to have one more (preferably in the Spring) for follow-up and parent connection.","cca are doing good . my daughter just dont know what she wont to do she has all her life to figer that all out right now she going though a lot","I am satisfied.","The only suggestion is that you make it easier to keep classmates together.  Each year I have to request that my son remain in the same class as kids he became friends with in kindergarten so it would be great if there was a way to request that during the intent to return process.","I wish the teachers were available to assist, also in person tutors at the drop in centers would be great.","Please think about keeping the same learning program as this year......we are use to it and like it.  Also, really important we have called administration or \"special education\" people within this past year with important calls and they have never, never called us back.  The only people who call back are our sons teachers other than that, so called \"higher ups\" must not know how to use the phone.  That has been our only major disgust.","I have no suggestions, all is well.","my students are graduating. Thank you","we are overall happy with CCA, the only thing I don't care for are all the portfolio's. I think some of them are confusing especially in English class.","I'm not really happy with your math curriculum. Try Saxxon math.","I think there need to be more opportunities for fieldtrips/ clubs that are closer to home.","Provide more career oriented field trips or summer camps.","you are doing great.","It is great","I would really like it if the planner for my kids could be transferred to a google calendar.  I use google and so do my kids and I we find it easier for everyone to keep track of our day to day stuff and if the kids planners could transfer to google it would help me as a learning coach.  Also if there is a way to upload portfolios from a google drive.","everything is great","The only issue we have had are technical issues with SmartyAnts in Clever. We had technical issues almost daily.","less emails! I get way to many and things that are important get lost in the lot and I find that I delete things I don't mean too","The online operating system seems to lag a bit and my girls complain that their laptops crash during online lessons.  I have not figured out why and this would help to get it fixed.  It appears to be software related.","I think CCA does a fine job as it is.  Teachers and admin. are always on top of my child's participation and grades and are genuinely concerned if there's a fluctuation in either.  Thanks for giving my graduating (with high honors) child an excellent high school education!!!","1.  The curriculum is far too politicized (particularly science and history) - probably little that CCA can do about it.  However, it would be valuable for students to be exposed to a wider array of views.  For example, my son's sixth grade science teacher stated as fact that global warming is due to fossil fuel emissions.  One could make the case that it could also be due in part to massive deforestation, natural temperature variance due to the 206-year solar magnetic cycle, or the production of other \"green-house\" gases due to livestock.  The point is that school should teach kids to think critiacally not indoctrinate them.","We just miss the movie/game night field trip that used to be held at the Crums Mill office, so we are excited for the new building to be open.","We would like to see science live lessons and social studies live lessons for elementary students","I have no complaints.  CCA has been very helpful for my family.","keep up the good work.","i don't know","I'm pleased with my experience with CCA.","I think they can better serve the families by continuing to do the great things they do and not to deviate from them.  Most of the times businesses start well in the beginning pleasing customers but then deviate which causes a person to have second thoughts and leave.  Just make sure to always make the families who attend CCA happy.","Opt us out of Star testing (haha) wish we could still have our free Hersey trip yearly.","All my needs have been met thus far.","Keep reinventing itself with new innovation.","They have been great.","I am happy with everything right now.","I wish that  CCA would find a way that children are able to attend local vocational/trade schools. Our local district accepts CCA students, however CCA declined him to be able to attend because some districts do not accept CCA students. I feel this was a great loss educationally to my child. A great disappointment, as i feel no student should be held back in an opportunity to better their education. My son has ADHD and I feel that he will likely not attend college when he graduates. He is spends endless hours self teaching himself mechanical education. To be able to attend our local vo tech while attending CCA as well he would have been able to graduate and be given a great opportunity to find employment right away. Due to the fact that CCA is lacking in allowing eligibility now to those who live in a district that accepts these students he will be held behind other students in our area. That is a great educational loss for my son. They should allow students that opportunity and work on their districts that don't allow. Those districts such as Harrisburg, have a larger employment availability when students graduate than other areas so if that is the only reason they should factor in that reasoning before denying students the ability to be able to support themselves after graduation. What a great loss for my child.","Doing a great job, cannot think of anything!","Care about the students. Make sure that NO CHILD's live lesson overlaps any other class.","When someone has an IEP, have someone on the learning support team continually reviewing their course load &amp; grades. Especially as a marking period is coming to an end. If  a student is in danger of failing an elective they really didn't need, someone should be reaching out to the parent so they are aware of that. So that a decision can be made to drop the course before a permanant F is recorded on their transcript. My son was assigned Game Design the first marking period with CCA. It was a big adjustment period for him as a student &amp; me as a learning coach to a home learning enviornment with all the core classes as well as Career Planning &amp; the Game Design. He ended up failing the Game Design when it wasn't really needed, it could have been dropped &amp; taken a later time. Now it's an F on his transcript he certainly could have done without. We didn't know it was a one marking period course &amp; that he wouldn't have time to bring the grade up later. His prior school averted that happening last year by recognizing his special needs &amp; removing a course he didn't need that he was struggling to get done. So I suppose I thought CCA would be watching for this as well, &amp; be proactive, yet they were not. I am now trying to have it removed from his transcript. His support teacher has been looking into this with me. Also, I am almost always waiting to hear back from Webmails. So does my son. He often cannot move forward to the next assigment without answers. &amp; I am currently waiting on responses to where I can find the curriculum details to choose his classes for next year so we can complete his intent to return.","One thing that could be better is to have more learning trips closer to our area.  I don't mind driving for about a half hour to a learning trip but most of them are just to far.","Maybe provide more opportunities to interact with other students","My son started late and is having trouble catching up. I'd like to know more about recorded lessons, which ones he needs to view and where to find them prior to doing the lesson.","Nothing else thanks","Provide better audio for live lessons. Although the mic quality is good by general standards, students with auditory issues can easily pick up the static, attenuation, and background noise.  \nProvide training in Microsoft office. Nothing makes my son put the brakes on an assignment faster than poor formatting.\nAlso, try to get teachers to think outside of the box.","N/A","Initially, I was not aware of the time commitment involved with being a learning coach. Luckily, my student is older and able to work independently. I only need to talk to her about her school work and check it as complete. It has been a challenge for me to get into the routine of checking the webmail and my daughter's school work. I also am a single parent and work full-time. It seems that some of the resources and activities are geared for parents able to participate in daytime activities and events. I am grateful that the events are saved and can be accessed later on-line (workshops and such).  Having the family mentor is a good resource, however that is one more contact/relationship to make and maintain, which has also been a challenge. It is good that the mentor is local to me, so she is familiar with my community.","The grading system needs improvement. I'm pretty sure the scores I'm seeing so far are inaccurate.","I have no complaints","I liked the way the school was last school. My child has a different have of doing his school work but he had to change everything this year because he needs to log in everyday, even if he is reading the books or doing stuff for gym class that day it doesn't count unless he logs in.","N/a","They are doing a great job.","The field trip descriptions are too long and confusing.  There needs to be a better and simpler way to list the field trips so it can be looked at easily without so much clicking around and reading.  I do not like having to print, sign, and scan papers each month for each of my child's special ed therapy services.  Too much busy work that's not really needed.  Perhaps find a way to electronically sign.  Also, some of the portfolio projects seem too advanced for this grade level.  I would change or eliminate some of the portfolios.  My child's teachers have dropped the discussion questions but I also feel those are unnecessary busy work and I would not include them in the new learning platform.  Also, art, music, gym, wood shop, or home ec. classes offered at the main offices would be wonderful!","I am not very happy with this school year's (2017-2018) curriculum. I felt that the curriculum was very tedious, cumbersome and overwhelming. There was simply too much. If I had actually used the curriculum as it was designed, I would have been homeschooling 10 hrs a day. And the quizzes and tests had very ambiguous answers. Many often times there were mistakes in the 'correct' answer. In general, I felt that the questions were confusing and complicated and not grade appropriate. That being said, the teachers were amazing and helped me navigate through the lessons. I am hopeful for next years curriculum. All other aspects of CCA have been fantastic. The curriculum was 'nightmare-ish' this past year.","I think CCA is doing a great job. Communication is the only issue with any organization  that usually needs improving and I think that is just an \"always\" thing everywhere. I do believe that overall CCA does an exemplary job.","Until the PA public school system does away with Common Core curriculum and state testing, there is nothing more that CCA can do","I'm glad CCA has been patient with my child. I just wish she participated more.","I can't think of anything. I love everything about this school!","Please continue offering quality education to our family! Thank you!","You are planning to change your system from Connexus, you need tell us exactly what will stay the same and what will change. Hopefully you have the new system in order by now, so you should tell us what exactly we will have next year.","I would like to see more opportunities for students to meet and engage in social activities.","Keep up the good work","Just let us know if there are things like buying class rings or dances or anything like that going. I love it when we can get class pictures done.","Continue to provide the same service to their students as they have demonstrated this year and in previous years.

I love the idea of sync but there needs to be more consistancy.

I think he would benefit from having a synchronous option like the Elementary School has.  Currently, he is at the Family Service Office in our area which is great for making him more apt to ask for help, however, it has it's drawbacks (i.e., classroom distractions, commuting time, etc.).  I think it would be great if there could be high school teachers in each of the core subjects, at the least, who could hold classes everyday with a small class size.","new curriculum","Nothing right now","the curriculum is awful. hate the recordings. too much busy work. the dividing of classes to morning and afternoon was an awful idea.\n\nnearpod = bad idea","N/a","The Lehigh Valley Region needs a CCA office and drop in center.  There are a lot of high school and middle school students in Northampton and Lehigh Counties that would benefit from a drop in center and receiving instruction in person.  It is over an hour drive to the Andreas or Bryn Mawr office from Northampton County.\n\nOver the years, there are less and less field trips in the Lehigh Valley region that families find interesting and want to attend.  Many families complain that it's not fair that they have to travel over an hour to a field trip or to a CCA office.","its great nothing it can do",".","I would like more help with managing very troublesome classes with my son. For instance maybe CCA could provide tutoring hours at their drop off locations. It would also be nice for CCA to set up relationships with outside tutoring companies that would give discounted rates to parents who enroll their children in their tutoring programs. My reason for saying this is the fact that I have a struggling math learner that needs more support. I am currently considering mathnasium for at least a 6 month enrollment. Its expensive and it would be nice to save.","I would like to see some vocational training programs implemented.","I feel like there are too many tests all at the same time at it's overwhelming for my son.  if tests and quiz were spread out more, not 2 subjects having tests the same day, or multiple test or quiz for the same subject within a week. or make it so u only have 2 test a month max would be nice. just a thought.","1) Teachers that teach every class thoroughly so I do not have to teach areas or subjects that they skip. I am not a teacher.\n2)  Substitute teachers to fill in when a teacher has an absence so I do not have to teach on those days. I am not a teacher.\n3)  The cost for one student in my school district is $13,200.00/yr. I have two children in school. I assume since my kids are in CCA\n      those monies are directed to CCA instead. You are being paid over $26,000.00 for my two children and yet I have to teach full \n      subjects myself, and fill in as a substitute teacher whenever my kids regular teacher is not there, which is quite frequently.\n      This, to me, is unacceptable!","I wish all teachers read all webmails, listened to messages or responded within a reasonable amount of time.  Some teachers we have only heard from once or twice the entire school year.  Other teachers are so wonderfully involved.","I can't complain about the service CCA has offers me and my family. Overall it has been good service.\n\n","CCA has great potential, but there are quite a few kinks, some of which are outside of its control. Being more responsive to students in real time would be helpful, but that would require higher staffing ratios, which means more money. Additionally, the curriculum has too many bugs and the teachers do not have enough ability to adapt it to real conditions.  Additionally, there are just far too many oddball people who turn to CCA, so  you end up with students who don't believe in evolution, students who are blatantly racist, students who have little academic support or motivation. That makes it a difficult environment for the average to bright student who simply wants to learn.","Less demanding portfolio's.  Sometimes I think the kids get confused about things, then they get frustrated, and then give up.  But they are to chicken to contact teachers for help because they are afraid that they will be embarrassed.  Not that any teacher would embarrass them but I guess they are embarrassed because they are not getting it. They don't want to feel stupid.  I think it would be nice if teachers see that students are getting behind that they would call the students and give them help and not just ask if they are ok because they will tell you that they are but they really are not.  Start looking to see what they are stuck on and get them started.  If not they just get farther behind and they don't really learn they just do it to get done and get by and that hurts them in the long run.  If they don't understand things they need to be able to have the time to understand before they move on.  I know its flexible and they are able to spend more time but when they start getting a lot of overdue lessons it stresses them out.","Make quick check, quizzes and test more friendly to the students. Needs to be more about what they learn in that unit and not some of the wall stuff.","Communication is great in Elementary but needs major improvements in MS.","Less busy work, more mindful scheduling of assessments. The fact that they are often all lumped together in one week, and too often with multiple assessments all in one day, is extremely stressful. Also, it is nearly impossible to complete all the lessons in the planner and have my child attend live lessons too. We are rarely finished in a 6 hour work day because the live lessons don't always coincide with the lessons in the planner. It is too time consuming to do both--I feel like there should be choice to do either or within that time period. I realize live lessons are not mandatory, but my daughter enjoys them and I work from home and cannot be my child's teacher full time.","The middle school live lessons are so close together that my student can only go to three a day maybe four.  If she goes to all of them she gets a 30 minute break.   It  is a long time to retain information to finish the daily quick checks after all the live lessons are finished.  We have to skip science live lessons to keep the day progressing and finished each day.  I hope she can someday attend all of the live lessons with better scheduling.  It would help to allow students that have an age difference to be allowed to participate on the same field trips.  It is difficult to go on different field trips and this limits my middle school student when her sister cannot attend and vice versa.  Also, live lesson times that are the same no matter what level a student is in elementary, middle school or high school.  It is hard when you have two students attending the live lessons at different times to make the school day efficient and for quiet at times to do lessons.","nothing","I'm not sure.","CCA HAS BEEN GREAT WITH OUR FAMILY . I DON'T THINK THEY CAN SERVE US BETTER!!!",null,"They are doing great!","I do not know at the moment.","CCA could better serve us if there was more events that were closer to our area. If my child had the opportunity to meet her teachers at an event that was close to us.","I honestly can't think of a way that CCA doesn't meet all of our needs already.  Yes, we have had our moments but they always iron themselves out.  Maybe hire more special ed teachers so their case loads are not so overwhelming and you don't have days questioning yourself how important is this to bother our LST? You don't need to be a detective to know that they are stretched thin and always are giving 100% of themselves to every student.","I think that CCA is trying as a whole to serve everyone's needs as best you can, and I see positive change in the availability of auditory prompts for the books, and look forward to the new learning system next year. I am lucky to have a student that loves to learn, we will find ways to help him socialize with kids his age. I feel that if they cannot learn how to deal with all types of people at this period in their lives, then they won't know how to handle the many different types of people they will encounter as they get older and have to live in the real world. Another plus we have, is that our student is raised around the family business, so he is aware of how people are, how to act in a professional setting, customer service aspects, and other facets of a work environment. That is something that should be taught , along with life skills with the world we live in changing so rapidly, with the children of today living in a virtual world.","The only thing I can suggest to make things \"better\" would be to have an office somewhere closer to the Saylorsburg area. Whether that would be Stroudsburg or Easton, it would be nice to have one closer than a 45-50 minute drive from where we live. I would also suggest a Guidance \"Tour\" in the offices for students in 8th, heading to 9th to get an idea of what courses are available to them.  Maybe hold it mid-year or just before mid-year. I know there's Career Planning and we can take a look at the course guides and contact guidance through webmail, but I think many families would feel better with a \"lay of the land\" meeting. I think it would take away some anxiety I hear about from other families in the situation.","Keep up the good work !","No more portfolios.","Middle school needs more electives, especially Music class. This is one thing I liked about the former CCA (now Reach). Music classes are important.","Not sure","I wish there was more in our area, not many activities are here.

CCA is fine to me.","I am already completely satisfied with how much CCA serves me currently","everything seems to be good...just a suggestion i know you did away with end of school year celebrations...why not try Knoebels amusement park, there parking and admission is free and if the parents get together and bring a dish of food and have a picnic for the kids?","More free access to online educational apps and websites","We have been extremely stressed out after being removed from Sync. The web/school portal revamp sounds like a great idea.

I feel that the school is always making improvements.","better curriculum","We have been very pleased with CCA.","As a parent I did not like how the grades went for the entire year this year. If the students gets one bad test score they have to carry it all year rather than getting a fresh start at the beginning of the third marking period. Also my child's scheduler was so messed up this year we never knew where we were in regards to the teacher. Some classes we were too far ahead and were told about it and in other classes we were too far behind and were told about that to.","I would like to see more hands on /field trip type events in the west central region of PA. We have had more opportunities last year and this year than in previous years but my only complaint with cyber school is the struggle with finding enough socialization without having to drive an hour or more.  While I know there are some great ones offered if you are able to drive the distance, Having 3 kids in three different age groups/grades makes traveling distances for field trips hard when they are not inclusive of all ages/grades because of the struggle to figure out what to do with the kids that are not part of the field trips.","I don't think it can it is doing a great job already.","Personally I feel that the math courses aren't challenging enough for my child,also I don't see him progressing with math.I don't feel that the teaching is up to par with other teacher.So I would say consider giving the kids in special classes harder material even though you might think it will difficult for them.","Discard Canvas indefinately","They all do an amazing job.","YOU CANNOT IMPROVE ON PERFECTION!!",";-;","Keep up the great work,  need to bring back the end of year trips.","More parent-teacher contact.   There is almost no contact in middle school.  Teachers rarely call, and when they do, they ask for the students right away.  Even though my daughter does very well, it would be nice to speak with each teacher at least once or twice a year.","I can't think of anything that could improve our experience with CCA.","I think CCA is terrific just how it is.","To some how get more families involved in going to field trips. We have planed for two different trips and they had to be cancelled because we were the only family that wanted to go.","N/A","The biggest issue I have with CCA is the fact they use Common Core. Any teacher in their right mind can see it is self defeating. Common Core teaches children to all think the same, floods their brains with needless information, and goes directly against Math Theory. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line. The father of geometry, Pathagoras, said this and it is mathematical theory. Common Core dumbs children down and would be the one reason I would eventually leave CCA. Get rid of it.","better communication between students and teachers and the rubric is so generic the teachers NEED to explain it sometimes if it is not a worksheet","Define a regular upgrade/check-in schedule for computers and other technology and stick to it.","Not fans of the 2 days per week of live lessons. Preferred 4 day schedule of early years.","I would like for CCA to adopt a Sync like program for all the school levels (elementary, middle school, and high school) so that special need children, like my son, benefit better from learning at their own pace.","CCA has been wonderful and we are happy with our experience.","nothing the school is amazing","Offer courses that a student has no desire to attend college.","While I understand why some instructors want to talk on the phone prior to setting up assignments, etc. it isn't the easiest method due to different time schedules when she is logged on and I am at work.  It held her up a bit in Biology because of this and now she is struggling trying to get on track with the lessons.","I am very happy with the service I have had so far with CCA.  I get a response right away or even in a timely manner when I webmail anyone.","Better communication would help keep the school going and keep parents happy.   Parents' concerns should be taken seriously to ensure what is best for the student.  As far as academics, teachers should be better fit according to each students' specific needs.  Students should be given all academic supplies to help them in every academic course they take. Transitions and Independent Living services should be provided to every student in need.  A wider variety in selection might be helpful.","N/A","by keeping up the great work!","I wish there were more live lessons for other subjects other than math and reading.","Improve the technology being utilized.  The HP laptop that was provided several years ago was returned because it was incredibly slow.  We ended up spending $1400 for a faster laptop for our student.","Better responds time","maybe more get togeathers in my area","There could be more field trips in our area. I would like for it to be easier to sign up for those field trips because right now the current process is tedious and confusing. There should be a way for us to list field trip suggestions so we don't run out of field trips in our area. I would love for there to be a closer family service center, and more events held there so we can build relationships. I would like more opportunities to meet the teachers and staff and for them to meet our children. There should be more help provided for families who can't readily pay for field trips like ours. I also feel there could be more help provided to pay for paper, ink, and internet per month for struggling families.","More local trips and get togethers.","So far so good.","Stop accusing kids of plagiarism when it isnt. Allow partial credit for partial correct answers,","Our teacher did mentioned we are going to have a new learning system next year, I am hoping it will be one a little more easy to navigate, I feel this system now does have quite an amount of helpful learning resources/aids but I find it quite confusing sometimes when trying to find certain resource/aid, I feel like I have to literally click 1000 times before I can find what I was looking for.","Information on businesses that provide homeschool/cyber school add-on programs to their curriculum.  Such as phys. ed., theatre, STEM program instruction.","N/A","Over the last two of our six years with CCA, I have become increasingly dissatisfied. I understand that a new learning platform is timely and in the works. This will be great for families (not ours) but for those  who require a more user family platform.  The curriculum especially the Science and Computer curriculum has become dated  and there are no engaging or competitive STEM face to face opportunities to engage learners. The science fair was a great attempt to engage and personalize the curriculum, but only two learners participated in the entire Southwest Region!   The STEM and Language conservatory virtually disappeared during the 2017/2018 school year and this has been unfortunate. Students at CCA needs a better platforms for learning and CCA as a whole has failed to adapt to the competitive and changing world to stimulate young minds.  It seems the school has become complacent with what may have worked years prior and had focused on attracting families who may not be a good fit for the school but has not done much to retain learners who came to CCA with the promise of cutting edge curriculum.","Provide ink and printer paper for when it runs out.","I think everything is great the way it is","I cant think of anything that needs changing at the moment.","Everything is perfect so far.","At this time I am completely satisfied","there needs to be an option for children who are struggling and need 1:1 assistance.\nthere needs to be an option for 1:1 tutors\nthere are way too many portfolios and not enough lessons.\nthere is not enough communication between students and teachers.  email is not appropriate.","It would help if some type of alert or reminder could be added to the student's calendar to remind them of certain LL's throughout the day that actually pops up on their screen. Some sort of pop up reminder added for anything as a learning coach we would like to remind the students to keep them on task as well as on schedule. The curriculum is redundant from both last year and this year, granted we are only in our second year and 2nd grade.  Different subjects are teaching the same type of items and topics. Example: Language Arts he has been learning about the country, and then social studies the same items/topics. I feel the language arts lacks depth and important skills being taught because items that are not really language arts items are being taught. Deeper topics, skills, teachings could be introduced to teach important language arts items sooner rather than later if the redundancy was not there. We stayed with CCA because we appreciate having a teacher and the online access CCA offers, but if we were making the decisions off of curriculum alone, I don't think we would stay. But we value the homeschool experience that does not require having to lesson plan even though we end up adding a lot of teaching due to the lac the curriculum gives, which we appreciate. CCA gives us a foundation to build off of and helps gauge what information schools all together are not giving. We enjoy CCA besides the curriculum.","We love the use of the drop in center. Allows my children to be as social as they are comfortabe while having a structured day.","You are doing it.","CCA sends textbooks and also has them available virtually within the lessons, my child has not used her textbooks very often. Ideally, they should only be sent if they are absolutely necessary.","Have teachers follow the book so the children can follow easier","I prefer the old social events CCA provides family because now there are so many string attach to field trip.","I would like to see students being able to work ahead without being \"punished\" with added assignments at the end of the year to account for \"attendance.\"  i also would like to see a different attendance procedure where the student logging in is equivalent to attending for the day.","CCA has been doing a amazing job with me and my child","One of the areas that I feel is lacking is the ability to facilitate those who wish to get ahead. Simply put, the guidance office needs more work. Our current middle school guidance counselor was very slow in the process of getting back to us when we were trying to do such- cost us nearly a month of time. Sometimes picking up a phone is needed versus sending emails back and forth! I feel like there should be better course guidance/planning overall for the middle schoolers. If we had not known what to do on our own in middle school (through research &amp; other parents), our daughter would not have been able to achieve all the classes she needed to in high school in order to be where she wanted to be upon graduation. I surely hope the high school guidance is better, however, I have heard that it is lacking compared to what the public schools offer. Please get this together CCA... this is our children's future!!","How I wish that there is a transportation for the students  if they have some event,exams or any trip going to the nearest CCA office.","Everything is great now and sounds like it will be even better next year.","Follow up with parents by the teacher more often.","Provide a more hands-on curriculum and less confusing curriculum for ELA.","Allow the parents to track and record their students daily attendance, class attendance and lesson completion on the new platform.  This would enable parents to have a better understand of where each of their students are with their studies.  Also, by doing something like mentioned above the school would know better which parent/ learning coach was engaged in their students learning. A win win!",".","We understand from a staff member that the computers issued by CCA should be upgraded on three year intervals. At present, my child is using the same computer issued in the fifth grade and she is now in the 9th grade!","Giving more time with virtual counseling and meeting them in person once a month. Keeping my classes space out so my child could have breaks in between.","As of right now, nothing. I am so excited about the new program next year!!","I am looking forward to the new LMS. I am hoping it will engage my ASD son more. He suffers from PTSD from his experiences in B&amp;M school and there are days his motivation is non-existent. There are teachers he likes, but he is not ready to trust the teachers yet. I would love meet and greets with teachers throughout the year in order to build trust. I have not met a teacher at CCA who has not expressed an invested interest in my son's success, however, my son does not share those feelings. I think perhaps his motivation would improve if he got to know the people behind the screens a little better.","have a better way of teachers getting back with sudents","CCA has done everything to serve our family the best way possible, in my opinion.","Everything is great so far!","Everything is fine","Make live lessons easier to access","I can not think of anything","N/a at this time.

A lot of teachers already do this however, there are a couple that do not and we have to constantly send webmails to them to ask where the modifications are. It gets really annoying when you have to do this all the time and then wait a couple days for a response. Also, teachers that are using outside resources to get work done or using the Google Docs instead of the message boards, is not helping my child any. They need to stick with what the kids know and where to find assignments. Not search all over the place for them.","They already service my family and me the best they can !!

I feel that by having more than one student from a single household, each child gets less out of the school. If two of my kids have grade level field trips the same month I have to choose which one gets to attend. This could be resolved by CCA paying for 8 or 9 field trips per year, instead of one a month. Also, CCA should pay for one Learning Coach per student, not per household. You don't get less funding for each of my kids just because they're siblings. At a museum or festival, if I tried to supervise them by myself, their experience would be more restricted because we'd all have to stick together instead of allowing them to explore more naturally.","Im excited to see how the new Edio system works next year and am hoping that it will resolve my one frustration. This year has been more difficult to keep our class schedules and the Connexus planners on the same page with the teachers.  Every teacher seems to operate differently in how they follow the planner and post weekly Live Lesson schedules and modifications. If there was one uniform way or place that all teachers communicated schedules and changes, it would be much less confusing/frustrating. I will say, though, that our family moved in the fall, and Im sure that has also contributed to my struggle this year with keeping our schedules straight. :) thanks for your time.","I think CCA has done a fine job.","THE ONLY STRUGGLE WE HAD THIS YEAR WAS THAT THE COMPLETED WORK FROM OUR CHILD WAS NOT UPDATED ON THE ONLINE PROGRAM AS BEFORE.

It is difficult for the teachers to see concerning behavior through a screen, and because my child is in gifted classes and has excellent grades, his teachers did not see any concerns. However, we are still in need of support, as schooling has become extremely stressful because of the lack of support that we are in need of.

Flexibility is good to an extent (and did help us), but too much flexibility becomes a problem when moving on to future setting in which one  must be prepared to take a test on a certain date and time (and within a certain time frame).  For honors students, there needs to be more rigor here.\n2. I was very upset with the move from using only Connexus to using multiple platforms for classes.  My older daughter had four different platforms: Connexus, Canvas, Acellus, and Foundations Digital.  I found it nearly impossible to follow her progress, and missed times when she was behind.  The person who used Foundations sometimes neglected to move grades over into the grade book.  I feel you should use the Connexus platform unless there is a very compelling reason to do otherwise.  The teachers seemed very excited about their platforms, but it was not very exciting for me as a learning coach.\n3. For most courses, and especially for math courses, it would be very helpful for the teacher to follow a math book.  This was done most years.  This year, the Statistics teacher did not do this.  I had to hire a $40 per session tutor twice weekly to help my daughter in part because with no text book to easily follow, a brief online lesson, and an often disorganized lecture, she could not follow the course and was failing.  Statistics is hard enough.  A textbook that takes things in order, step by step, along with highly organized teaching makes a big difference for both student and learning coach.  (Mrs. Owens is fantastic at this!)","I'm happy with CCA.  Keep up the good work.","N/A","Have the location for state testing more local for families","I am very interested in the new system that will begin in the fall.

We have seen tons of changes throughout the years. I love the added live lessons from start to present. The teachers are wonderful as well! The only complaint I have is my son and daughter both struggle with reading. My son had two reading classes per week with the reading specialist because of changes that arose after break his reading classes have ended. The reading specialist was moved to another grade. He was making great progress in reading and loved the classes. Its sad to have something that is a great benefit taken away","N/A","Dont understand this question ...","CCA is awesome and I am completely satisfied.","Thank you for accepting ,my little brother into your school.","All is great \n","Teacher response and communication needs to be greatly improved. The class LL, planner, and agenda are very inconsistent with each other. It is difficult to know where my child should be on any given day. I have a child with an IEP, so I like to keep track of what my child is doing on a regular basis. But it is difficult to know exactly what is going on with all the inconsistency. I constantly have to email the English and Math teachers asking for tests, class notes, and/or modifications to be posted and/or graded. I should not be chasing down these things. The teachers should be doing them automatically. In addition, the English teachers could serve my family better if they would update the message boards with the current schedule. Every teacher consistently states to check the message boards for updates. Well, the English message board calendar has only been updated once this year and that was after I brought it to their attention and asked for an updated calendar. It is very frustrating. I have discussed these issues with teachers and administrators yet nothing shows improvement. My student and I do not like having a group of teachers that teach Concept A and Concept B. CCA needs to go back to one teacher per subject with one LL per day in each subject.","Weekend field trips and socials would be great","Continue with being flexible to meet the students present and future careers/college direction.","The serve that CCA has given me is perfect.","Keep up the good work!","CCA can help me by helping my daughter go to a technical school after she graduates.","Kept the teacher you have now.

Over the course of the year we have received many mixed messages and communications this year.\n\nI would like to see more integration of the services with his regular school day.  Right now they are stand alone services and at times seen as busy work, esp. since they are outside a normal school day.  This makes his day long from starting at 9:00 a.m. to prepare for LL at 9:30 and finishing at 4:45 - 5:00 when his OT or SLP leaves.  A long day for a 6 year old.

We are extremely happy.","I can not think of anything.","Just keep doing what you're doing!","Everyone has been very responsive anytime I have had a question - thank you!  I do notice that a lot more is happening on the eastern side of the state - although we do have great field trips here!  One thing I've been struggling with is how to get my shy daughter to meet some of the other students - there is not much time for field trips, and even when we are on field trips, they are filled with learning and activity and not much social time.  Maybe - just like I got a family mentor - a new student could get a student mentor?  Not sure that's for everyone, just a thought I had. Or maybe icebreakers or some other forced \"getting to know you\" time or even lunch could be built into the field trips and other social events?  Again, we have not been to many, so maybe there is that time already and we've just missed out on that.","I think CCA is doing the best that they can.","I'm happy with CCA","I'm very please with my choice","We're on a tight budget so I'd like to see more field trips be free for my younger student. Our older student has been enrolled enough years for most of them to be free but I'd like to see a loyalty program type deal where incoming new students could have the free trips if there is a sibling who has \"xx\" number of years already with CCA. I know there will always be certain trips that cost money and I'm fine with that because they are always worth it.","One thing that can change; On the multiple answer questions, instead of getting the whole answer wrong if you don't have all the choices picked, maybe give partial credit.","I wish they had a program to help children with specific learning disabilities such as dyslexia and dysgraphia.","Nothing","By not giving so much work loads.I would like cca to space out the work","The information sessions or great start sessions need to be more realistic, with regards to the amount of work for students, the amount of participation from the learning coaches, and the actual amount of socialization ( very little).","Their excellent already.","Keep up the good work.","Making sure that the learning platforms such as the new edio platform coming out soon are updated regularly and maybe by having teachers offer more private LL sessions with students.","Be more understanding when explaining the system","don't know","It has done me the justice it guaranteed","na","Teachers need to call more.","its fine","Communicate better by returning phone calls and messages left!","I can't think of anything at the moment.

I don't know if this is possible, but it sure would be nice!","Everything is super!",".","everythyng ist ok","Better communication with LC/parents I have found once students move into middle school I have had limited communication with my Childrens teachers in 6,7,8 grade. I think teachers should still speak with parents at least once a quarter.","CCA is doing great","No suggestion. Just hopeful new system will be better than Connexus.","Not enough time is spent on teaching math.","Nothing at this time everything is just right","Make the transition from public school to cyber school more informative with how they will have to do their homework and submit things such as the portfolio.","The only  way that I feel is through offering more field trips or get togethers in our area most of the ones that were scheduled here were canceled and my daughter looks forward to them.","I feel cca has met all my needs this school year.","Be more consistent.  We are told Live Lessons are totally optional.  We are on a 3 week call schedule which the teacher set us up on but if 2 weeks go by with no call or Live Lesson attendance then my child is in approaching alarm.  That's regardless of her attendance being logged, portfolios and tests being submitted, and courses completed.  We are the ones putting in the hours and creativity to effectively teach our kids.  All the Live Lessons are good for is review but my child is bored of it by then.   We just quit attending them.  Also our teacher missed so many this year.  She had another teacher fill in who would not acknowledge my student at all.  In my opinion, when you are an online public school teacher, talking to and interacting with the children in your LL room should be part of your job description.   Curriculum wise, there are many times questions on tests, etc. are downright confusing.  In Language Arts especially, we watch videos over and over about the same boring stuff only to find at the end of the lesson we are told to talk to our child about something not previously mentioned like \"stable end syllables\" or whatever they are called.  It seems a video for this would be very helpful.  My daughter just submitted a \"candy bar fundraiser\" portfolio for math that had no rubric.    So she demonstrated an amazing understanding of the material and had her assignment turned in early, only for the teacher to deduct 2 points because it was not done by hand!!  This was a math assignment, not Language Arts, she has to take computer and typing classes, and this is online school.  Had there been a rubric, email, or other directions requiring this in handwriting then that's exactly how it would have been turned in.  I just don't like the inconsistencies.  You feel you are playing by the rules only for the teacher or school to find loopholes.  How is that encouraging or supportive?","Unsure","I am not sure?","I don't really know","I believe that the curriculum  changes that are being made , should be a great improvement.  I do think we should have more typing review and other software available to students. Especially the ones with IEPs.  More meet and greets with the teachers and staff. And more programs for the more rural students. We have to travel about 100 miles to get to some meeting and programs.","Not sure lol","CCA is fine right the way they are.","everything is fine","I would like for the teachers to better communicate with the parents and students.","It served us well","I was very satisfied with CCA and I felt we got great service.","Just to stay communicating with me and my family, whether its by telephone or email.","By taking the work easy on my daughter because she also works.","Excited for the new changes CCA  has for the 2018-2019 school year.","Have all the same access on the childs sign in for the learning coach, like be able to see live lessons and review them from our sign on and the planner on the learning coach's end to show both child and family stuff, I did not add anything to our calendar so I have to go in my childs planner to see lessons, I think it would be easier if just one planner and its combined.  I had to log out of mine and in to my sons a lot to get the information I needed or access to lessons that I needed to help him with.","I will like to see fairness at the centers, not showing favoritism.  Teachers should not be teaching their family members.  Children should not be held back to wait on the class, if they can push on they should be allow to do so.  I will also CCA to teach children to play an instrument eg. violin, keyboard, drums, recorder etc.  They should also have sports days with the different centers coming together at different locations each time.  Children should be complimented on their good work.  Center Assistants should listen when the children speak not ignore or sweep things under the rug because of favoritism.  I can go on and on.  Serve me by educating my child to the fullest and keep her safe.\nThank you.","I have no complaints.","Just continue to be as supportive and responsive as you always are","Bring Right brain learning and vision therapy as well as  dyslexic reading programs.","n/a","We are satisfied with the service we have received.","again I have no complaints.","N/A","Less Portfolios","I was pleased with how attentive the staff and teachers were to my son's needs.","I would like to see possibly groups formed for social outlets. I understand there are field trips however the possibility of meet ups etc.  I would say the lack of peer relationships has been the hardest for our daughter.","I don't know. I've let my oldest stay in cca by her request. My others I took out of cca three years ago and they have excelled in their school. Too much burden was placed on me. I think cca requires too much from the learning coaches.  My oldest daughter who has chosen to stay struggles greatly and can't keep up. I personally would prefer her to go to the regular brick and mortar.","we are happy with your service!","Highly satisfied","My only concern with CCA is the teachers unwillingness to share information on how to obtain IEP's.","Have all of the learning support iep modifications loaded directly into the learning management system on a timely basis as well.   Also have all of the curriculum in one dedicated learning system instead of having to go to different programs to find what you need to do.  Also have what you actually need to complete in the LMS instead of having what the teacher wants you to do out on some message board.","None","More grade level social gatherings with teachers","My child uses recordings to complete many of his lessons since he receives speech and OT which often conflict with lesson times. This year, for the entire year, the recordings only worked about 50% of the time. Often we could see the teacher going through the lesson, but there was not sound. It is my understanding that attempts have been made to correct the technical difficulties, but the problem remains. It made this year much harder to learn and used a great deal of time. \nI am also a bit concerned that two or more of our \"veteran\" teachers have left CCA recently. Both were very capable teachers and it was very reassuring to know I could contact them if needed to answer tough questions.","Offer more electives....this year my daughter, who wants to be a teacher, chose Early Childhood Development when picking classes, but it was no longer available since CCA decided to break away from Connections Academy.  If things hadn't changed, she would have been better prepared for her college classes.  As it is, she had to take classes she wasn't even interested in at all just to fill her course load as a full time student.\nCCA should also re-evaluate their testing changes they've made in elementary school.  The majority of Language Arts tests are just read and answer questions like 'author's purpose'....which is absolutely each reader's opinion, not a definite answer.  I might think the author wrote something for a totally different reason than the next person.  While comprehension is very important, test on what they learned in the lesson.\nThe amount of testing is horrible....my 5th grader has a Practice he has to complete in the same lesson that he has a quiz.  The quick checks every day are enough, why do a Practice right before you do a quiz?  it is overkill.  Then in another couple of days there's a discussion, then before you know it, another test or portfolio!  It just too much.   There is too much testing at the high school level as well.  It can get overwhelming.","Not sure","CCA is serving my son very well.  I don't have a suggestion.  I am excited to learn about the new curriculum for next year.","I dont know yet we just started","I think they are doing a great job!","I think your doing a good job so far.

Each year there is less and less communication between learning  coaches and teachers. This year the planner for my students has been misplacing their lessons way too far ahead which has caused confusion for me as their learning coach. It has not been able to be fixed by the teachers either. It's been frustrating for my kids as well.","Great school!

I have learned to sync the kids schedules with the classes so that they can fully benefit from the lesson. I was working very hard to not be redundant with lesson content especially when they had covered information in Live Lesson during the day. It would be helpful if the teachers lesson plan was made available to learning coaches and students. We have received pacing calendars from teachers throughout the year but it hasn't been consistent. Although it was VERY helpful. I know not all families make Live Lessons a daily part of their school days but for those of us who do daily updates and pacing calendars would be very helpful.","So far, I am satisfied with CCA.","It would have been nice to have the grade-level field trips closer to us.

I understand that they can not sit at their desk awaiting my student's call but I would say 99% there in not an answer to the phone. Once a message is left it takes multiple days before a response is received and often times multiple messages have to be left via phone and e-mail before a response is received. It can be quite frustrating when a simple question can not be answered promptly so that the student may proceed with the work at hand. This ends up putting them behind which frustrates them and then there is a hard push to catch up after the answer is finally received.  The staff is helpful once we get in contact with them.","I'm out of words because CCA is perfect.","Would like to see more extra curricular activities, like band, chorus, plays , available through cca.

You need to have your student more engaged into fun things.  The teachers seem to gravitate toward the students that have better grades.

CCA should at least provide 6 tickets per student, so the student can have the most important people in their lives with them on their special day.  If CCA could shave off some of the non essential person's from the graduation for the sake of the graduates that would be greatly appreciated.  This is the Seniors big day, that will only occur once, they shouldn't have to be unhappy because some family members had to be left out of this once in lifetime moment.  This is my son last year with CCA and all my other children have graduated from CCA in the years ago, I am offering a idea to help some of the students that will still be attending CCA.  Their are some wonderful teachers at CCA that make up for some of the teachers that aren't so great at teaching.  CCA criminal investigator teacher really needs to have more experience in the course to teach it.  He lacks the experience needed to teach the course, he also doesn't lose his audience while teaching, he is quite boring.  His behavior lacks interest in the course he is teaching.  He needs to learn how to make this course interesting, and bring life to it.","You do a  good job already.","Update webmail so learning coaches can block webmail from other students for a certain time.  My daughter was distracted a lot this year with webmail from her classmates.  I would like to turn on a function in webmail to say \"No webmail from other students\" from 9 am to 1 pm, for example.  It would have given my daughter a chance to concentrate better.","In elementary school years, the CCA program was a lot more flexible.  The curriculum in middle school is boring and my daughter completely lost interest in school. We will be homeschooling next year to focus on topics she enjoys while learning. I find that if my daughter isn't interested in what she is learning her brain just turns off to the idea of school. She has learned to hate school now because she has to read the same story three times, although she is quick to pick up the concepts within one read. And I did not appreciate her reading The Watsons Go to Birmingham  with the language used in the book. The teachers have been nice and helpful but honestly I just don't think this is the right fit for us anymore.","nothing","nothing right now","Continue to provide support","I would love to see a mobile friendly app with optional push notifications for webmails, rather than having to log in through my phone browser or getting on a computer.\nI think having to approve completed lessons is a waste of my time and is pointless. \nI liked that PA Cyber counted attendance automatically when my child logged in rather than me having to fill out an attendance form, but am glad that we no longer have to calculate hours.\nI know it's easier said than done, but eliminating PSSA tests would be excellent. What a waste of time and resources! \nI'd like to see more on-site social and learning activities. PA Cyber offered weekly dance and art classes for elementary kids on site. They were more for social activities than serious dance or art, but my daughter loved them. There was mention of movie/game nights when we enrolled, but we never saw any at our local branches... I assume because of construction. An on-site gym class would be fun. \nI was disappointed when I received my box of supplies from CCA that not much other than books was included. PA Cyber sent manipulatives and supplies for projects (soil, beans, plastic pots, compass, rulers, paper, gym supplies, etc) but CCA requires us to purchase those things out of pocket which is hard for our single-parent household. We often have to resort to YouTube videos. \nThe ISP/supply stipend is helpful, but I'm disappointed that it ends over the summer and that it barely makes a dent in the cost of internet service and supplies. PA Cyber paid out $50/month year round. I'm glad that it's automatically sent, though... PA Cyber required us to mail them our internet service bills.","I have no concerns at this time.","Stay","Can't think of anything right now","Communication  needs to be more timely between all teachers and family.   For all teachers on the student's team to  better understand the student's special needs.  For modified tests to be modified for the individual  student not just a watered down version to try to fit all needs.  There needs to be more of an emphasis on critical  writing in the middle school LA curriculum.  Having live lesson  classes back to back without a break is not condusive for active learning.  The student that needs a 10 or 15 minute break must make the choice to not attend or go to class late.  Give at least 15 minutes between live lesson classes.","nothing","Everything is working well for us.","I am happy with the support I receive from CCA.","I think the children at ccac had too many portfolios which required a lot to day.

It took us at least 4-6 months to understand where to actually find things the teacher was using or talking about.  I still don't know if our daughter has found everything the teachers talk about.  I know we as parents have not and we just feel, ok, we are getting along and I guess that is ok.   Parents that are not computer savvy would have a hard time as we did...","Not available at this time","Looking forward to seeing how edio improves things! I would love it if I could choose to enroll them in certain core subjects. For example, they take math, science and I would teach Language Arts, History with my own curriculum that I prefer. That would be awesome!!!","Better books and some classes better directions","na","N/A","I know it's hard because of the rural area that we live in... but having more opportunities to meet up with families and teachers in our area would be great! The closest CCA location to us is 45 minutes away... and there is hardly anything ever going on there.  I know this issue has more to do with where we live and public funding, not so much with CCA, so I get it! :)\nI would also love to see CCA more present in social media to help de-stigmatize Charter Cyber Schools. I try to share as much as possible, and have had some success with friends and family, but there is still a lot of negative association with it.  What you all provide is AMAZING and more people should know the truth about how great it is to have the OPTION of this school choice!! I can't stand the negative comments from people thinking my kids are going to be socially awkward, must have been bullied, or that it is some crazy hard option that parents \"can't do\".  Keep hiring and training teachers that come alongside the parents and students. Please don't ever skimp on treating these teachers like the rockstars they are. WE LOVE THEM and I am certain our school experience would not be the same without them!","I am can't wait so see the changes that will be in the new year. I am sure they will  be better in see all my children schedules easier.","I know that changes are already in the works, but I do have a couple suggestions for the new software. Get rid of \"check all that apply\" questions unless points are awarded for each part of the question. (Right now, they can get 6 or 7 correct, for example, but receive 0 of 1 point awarded.) Also, when parents have to click on the lessons to indicate that they are completed, it would be nice to be able to see the students' scores. As it is, you have to exit that screen, enter the gradebook for each area of study, and then return to the original screen. A link to that particular lesson would be nice, as well.","Just helping me get my child through school to graduate.","unsure at this point","This year we struggled tremendously trying to learn and navigate the Math and LA.  It was brutal.  But, I know that this has been taken care of for next year, and we look forward to a fresh start with some new curriculums.  Glad I never felt alone with this matter between parents and teachers.\n","I WAS OVERALL VERY PLEASED WITH CCA.","We appreciate all that has been done so far.","Less emails. There is too much to go through each day","CCA is performing at such a high level.  My son's teacher, Mrs. Wissinger, has all the components of a master teacher.  She is a huge part of what has made this year such a shining success for us!  I highly encourage CCA to continue recruiting teachers that are highly skilled and passionate about the teaching profession.  This is paramount to success and can never be stressed enough.","CCA is doing everything they can to serve my family already","More engaging activities for the students tailored to their age groups.","Keeping scheduled assignments in line with the week(M-F).","I am not happy with some of the curriculum.  Since it is changing next year, this might be a moot point.","I believe it has served me well. The only downside I can think of is the student ability of getting on U tube when they should be on lessons. Also have the Love and Logic courses closer to rural areas.","They do their best and thats good for me.","n/a","CCA has served us well.","N/A","An issue we are having is that my twins have different 4th grade teachers and standards are different between the teachers so we are unsure as to what to expect. Academic standards should be the same across the board. Teachers need to get back to the families sooner.","I would love to have the weekly schedule earlier as our entire family plans around the children's schooling.  Often l get the weekly schedule a half hour before the first class. There are days classes are a recording or cancelled, and our work schedules could have been more convenient had we known earlier.  Also, our child has a class at 9:30 and one at 2.  this is not convenient to the other things we have to do.","Have more age-appropriate content in the curriculum for English.  Pick stories and topics that edify and strengthen our children.  Have teachers that do not show political bias in the classroom.  I understand history in a public school curriculum has been rewritten, but both sides should still be presented.  Social studies classes in general have been liberally biased.","keep the flexibility, Tests should be able to be saved to go back and finish at a later time.","CCA has done the best job it can to serve my children.","I am content with all that CCA does for my family.","I think you do all you can....it is up to the child to do the rest.","I cant think of anything so far everything has been amazing","I hope they revamp some of the lessons. My 3rd grader had a hard time this year with the way a LOT of the questions were set up in the math and language arts. There were trickily worded questions, and that is my ONLY gripe. We've never had a problem before. My daughter has been with CCA since 5th grade. She's in 11th next year. This was the first year that i really didnt like how the questions were given in the assessments. It was like they wanted to be difficult and trick them. Fix them. That's my big issue. \n","We are looking forward to the new curriculum.","Need to keep program flexible.  Need to have a syllabus for each class. Teachers need to provide feedback, even if the student is doing very well.  Need teacher-student relationships (having 5-8 teachers per subject was not beneficial in my opinion).","Better online experience","COntinue being responsive and great!","Ugh, can you improve the technology aspect for someone who is technologically averse? The print doesnt always print and troubleshooting isnt intuitive.  I hate the scheduler and still have figured it out after three years.  You need a better way to assign and collect portfolios. I still have a hard time fingering out where information is and which bulletin board is what.  Plus the webmail system needs an overhaul.  Theres way too many steps just to pick an addressee! I also want the ability to monitor my childrens webmail and block other webmail users.  I also want the ability to block certain websites or at minimum get a weekly report of sites and time spent on them.","Come up with ways (other than searching the directory) to facilitate introductions between students who live near each other.\n\nI don't know how students are assigned to teachers, but it would be nice if students and their homeroom teachers could be located as close together as possible (rather than at opposite ends of the state).\n\nWaiting to see if Edio addresses any other concerns specific to the Connexus changes this year.","I feel that Cca is doing a great job and this time i cannot think of anything .","Although a flexible schedule is important to us, many students need to receive a bit of pressure from their teachers in order to be motivated to stay on track. My daughter is one of these students, and she fell behind by MANY lessons in all of her classes, and only one teacher reached out to her to encourage her to keep up.","It would be beneficial to our child as a student if, we could get an IEP for him, as we have been ;communicating with CCA for a few months now, without progress to do so. As a child with special needs, although bright, he is scattered and has many anxieties which  deter his testing abilities and social interactions. He has become overwhelmed with the work load he has encountered this year. I have reached out to a few people both by phone and email correspondence however am still in a suspended status, awaiting for an answer. It is pretty disheartening, to be totally honest.","Easier layout of information on website.","CCA has been great. More communication between the teachers and the parents would be the only added necessity","I'm not sure.","Create a guideline for coaches to have everything structured for the day. When helping their child with a specific subject.","Nothing at this time","well they could help provide internet for some of the students as well.","nothing at this time","it can't...it just can't","At this point, my grandson has been very blessed to have had the teachers and courses he has had.","Be more clear about the curriculum. Have everything on one page, my child has complained to me that some lessons were on the connexus day plan, some were on the message borad and some were webmailed to her. Overall confusing for the student, I think CCA shouls either stick with the connexus plan or wait altogether to implement the new curriculum coming this 2018-2019 school year.","na","Get rid of Common Core Math. It is a detriment to these children.","N/A","N/A","no comment","I believe that CCA has gotten better each year that my child has attended.

I can't think of anything at the moment.","At this time, I can't think of any suggestions.","You are doing a great job.","the services are great for me","CCA can improve by offering more electives like more psychology kinds of classes, law classes audio classes, more language classes other types of math classes.","The curriculum changes at the elementary level was a challenge to navigate this year.  Also, the school was to have information about the upcoming curriculum by Thanksgiving, and I have not seen any new information about this curriculum which concerns me.  This is why I am hesitant to say we are coming back next year.\n\nLikewise, my son's 2nd grade teacher seemed to be disengaged and not really excited about her job.","Have more events and learning coach workshops closer to my area.  There is an office in Williamsport, that has a couple of events yearly, however these are almost all for the students.  I would love to be able to attend all the events aimed at improving how to best assist my child in the cyber school environment, however the closest location is about two hours away, which is just not feasible for my family situation. The vast range of support and education offered through CCA for the coaches is diverse and frequent, just sadly not an option for those of us not located near a major city.  Williamsport is a larger than average area in the state, and I was surprised and disappointed that not many opportunities take place here for just the coaches and parents.","it is great","Doing a great job now","I hope there will be a bus for kids that go to school activity like field trip.","Nothing, your doing a fantastic job!","Thank you for everything.  We appreciate the services you provide as a cyber school.","n/a","They need to hire more staff in the Special education department who are capable of completing IEP's and requested services in a timely manner. In the last year CCA has lost many special education staff members and my children's IEP's and 504 were passed from one person to the next. They have no clue what is going on. It took a year after a formal request to have additional testing done and an IEP meeting. They are continuously out of compliance and just say there is nothing we can do about it we are understaffed and just enrolled more children who need IEP's. That is not the fault of the parent. There is a lack of communication between teacher's when changing a child's curriculum. The new teacher's are left wondering how to help the learning coach. Communication is a major issue with your school.","Most of the teachers are great, but have been dissatisfied with a couple teachers.","Instead of expecting for the children to ask for help maybe assign tutors to the ones who really need help","I still find the website hard to find answers in.","No complaints. Everything CCA does is amazing!","Your doing great.","Would like to see more diversity in electives for the high school level .   Like Art","nothing","At this rate I'm not sure it can, to be honest.","doing well","Satisfied",".","Not sure","Maybe a bit more communication from the teachers (the art and gym teachers )","Improve your technology base since there are a lot of problems during live lessons.  Provide more challenging options for STEM at a younger age.","The downloads don't always work.  There should be some physical interactions with learning coaching on how to use the system.  Some of the subjects are a bit much for a kindergarten student. I think the Physical Education lessons are ridiculous. It would be nice to hear from other CCA representatives other than the teachers.","n/a","I have no suggestions at this time. I'm very satisfied with everything.","so far, so good!","None","N/A","I believe that every homeroom teacher should have to call their students parents  once a month or quarter. My ninth graders checks in this year and last year both my boys homeroom teachers did. This phone call not only keeps the line of communication open for parent and teacher but also student and teacher. My sixth graders homeroom teacher hasn't called however his language arts teacher has(not as often) and my son feels special. The parent can ask the homeroom teachers how a child is doing in all their classes though.","not sure they can everything is going well","It has been difficult reaching someone about my son's 504 plan","No suggestions!

I also need info on the AP Computer Science Exam -- date, time, etc.  Thanks!","no comment","Hire qualified, educated professionals that know how to service the individual learning needs of those that are in need of special education supports &amp; services. Remind staff that it's not about the money, it's about the students. Have LEAs at IEP meetings that actually know about special education, actually listen to the IEP team, remember it's not about the money but rather about what a student needs in order to be successful. Uphold compliance of special education documents. Listen to the students who are asking for help and actually return their calls and webmails. Train teachers to actually know how to utilize the programs. It is a shame on the downward spiral that has happened at CCA, specifically about the special education department. We enrolled over 5+ years ago because CCA was about family, meeting the needs of students, and creating a flexible learning path based upon the learning styles of the individual. We used to be proud to say our kids go to CCA and they were excited to graduate from CCA. Now our student who has been at CCA the longest, and entering into HS, wants to leave CCA because the teachers don't call him back, they don't grade papers for weeks sometimes months at a time, &amp; they rush through LiveLessons. It's a shame that teachers acknowledge a student by their disability instead of their ability. More training on how to write documents that don't have numerous grammar, spelling, and wrong kids information in the documents (has happened on multiple occasions). Bring back the amazing teachers and administrators who have left CCA due to the lack of quality that has occurred over the last year or so. CCA has gotten too large. They have lost the focus and purpose of which CCA was built upon, a customized, flexible, individualized learning experience brought to you by high quality educators and administrators who were there for the students and their families and to celebrate the end.","Give us options for scholarships based on my daughter's scholastic achievements, not her community service.","I honestly feel that CCA has always served us in a very helpful and prompt way. We have been very satisfied and happy with CCA.","Wouldn't change anything","not sure yet","Nothing additional is needed at this time.","Not sure.","They are awesome","I'm good.  Thanks.","N/A","What they do is just fine","The nearest training for this new portal that CCA will be using in the future is in Harrisburg which is 1.5 hours away. Given that there are a good number of families in the Philadelphia area why isnt a training being offered in this area? It almost makes me feel that Commonwealth Charter is moving to focus more on that region. If this is the case I would like to know so that I can make a decision that best suites my family and our needs.","I do not have any suggestions to serve better than CCA already does. I am extremely satisfied.","With the curriculum.","n/a","I do have one suggestion.  Regarding elementary art, I think the kids would get much more out of this if a teacher was teaching them.  Having been able to now see the difference in the experience that my boys in middle school have had over my boys in elementary school, a teacher taught class would be much better.","Although most teachers are very caring, understanding, and seem to know how to teach, others should not be teachers. Namely: Michael Coone and Shawn Rudy as 7th Grade teachers. I honestly do not know why they were hired. Whomever does the hiring needs to do better. These two seem to have no idea what being a teacher means. Not all teachers have the same learning style, which I expect, however neither of them have an understanding of the term teach. I myself train people on a daily basis, so I know what being a teacher means. I think you should be more critical in the future about who you bring on as teachers, and who should be hired as a different staff member.","Improve the curriculum so that teachers have more access to adapting it as it needed.  Also, have career planning workshops at more sites, like the Seven Fields office.","I love everything about CCA, but i feel some of the curriculum is very hard for my children. I feel some of this work should be work they do in college if they chose to. Some of the classes can be overwhelming for the high school student. Alot of different confusing things all at once.","i think the portfolios are sometimes not necessary, and maybe the quick checks should count a little more for people that sometimes struggle with grades to give them a little extra help. other then that cca has served my daughter very well this yr.","I like it so far","Na","CCA serve's me well.",null,"N/A","N/A","Let's remain on the same for the remainder of my son's education and healthy development.","More field trips in our area ( Adams County )","help with more special learning teachers for the kids that need help","They are wonderful","Miss having the Stem conservatory programs each month.

I've been told that University professors sometimes do this also and it's \"normal\" in some brick and mortar classrooms too.  This is my one frustration, to set yourself apart, encourage your teachers to strive for excellence.   Are a few being overloaded with students?  Are they simply not doing their jobs?  Is anyone checking?  Most of the teachers have been excellent and really seem to do their best.","Get ALL teachers on the same page with their level of service to families.

Information on SAT/ACT deadlines and other college tasks would be helpful.\nHardcopy textbooks for all classes. It is impossible to learn math or a language without a reference text.\nMore field trips in all areas of the state instead of favoring the areas that are more populated with the most students or are convenient to the coordinator.\nProvide hands on science lab experience for every child at ALL offices.\nAn everyday lesson would be ideal especially for math and foreign languages.\nGet rid of online only classes.\nRedo the foreign language classes so that it is more user friendly with textbooks and daily live lessons.\nTeachers should actually teach EVERYDAY and if the student chooses not to learn that way or cant attend lessons for whatever reason, then the recording is there. Teachers should be giving instruction on each and every lesson. \nIf each teacher taught the same class lesson two-three times a day (just like a brick and mortar), and teach a different lesson everyday (just like a brick and mortar), then student can tailor class attendance to their schedule each day, yet still get daily instruction from every teacher instead of learning and teaching themselves. \nEliminate lesson work in addition to live lessons. If a teacher teaches a concept and a student is in attendance, then that should count as their class for the day, unless there is an out of class assignment or a \"homework\".\n\n","CCA can continue to look for ways to improve it's system.","I am satisfied with the program.","I cant think of anything right now","I cannot think of anything.","Lighten up on the portfolios and lighten up on the back to back tests and quizzes.  Give at least 2 days on each subject instead of flying through the lessons and only giving one day for the kids to jam newly learned material in their brains.  My kids do complain sometimes that it's not enough time to even understand something because it's on to the next topic the very next day.  A different format needs to come about because the kids have live lessons as well as lessons with quick checks, they barely get study time since portfolios and tests are running up on them every other day---it is definitely a rushed environment.","Everything at CCA is great the way it is now.","As my students reach high school, I hope there is an option for receiving textbooks in their curriculum - and that it follows their online class.  The ability to work from the computer is great, however, they also need actual textbooks.  Not only is it good for the brain and the eyes, it is also important for better comprehension of the information covered.\nAlso, in the art classes for middle school, a greater effort to do the lesson \"art\".  Since most of the projects are not sent to the teacher, they got lost in translation, so to speak.  I had to share with my daughter that there is a project in each lesson, which she started to do, but lost interest again over time.  However, all the art portfolios, she did--and enjoyed-- she did them because they were a requirement to the course.  Making more of the projects a 'requirement' rather than optional would prove an advantage to get the students creative abilities going.  \nBrainstorming as groups.  Clear direction from teachers that talking is necessary.  Answering via mic, not always typed.  Encourage kids to speak.  Some do this without prompting, but to teach kids how to communicate - they need to talk--not just type (or text).  Though this is essential for the LC's (and parents) to teach, it can be incorporated from the teachers side too.  If teachers don't require it, students won't do it.\nMusic/chorus - smaller - consistent classes in multiple central locations to be able to: A. Work with other students, B. To grow in their musical knowledge, and C. Enjoy what their learning.  In many ways- people learn by doing - Music is best taught by doing - not by reading.","n/a","The stipend for internet isn't high enough. My internet cost is $64 a month.

I also feel it's really hard when your child is struggling and there really isn't any one on one with the teacher to receive help. It basically gets put on you as the parent, and I didn't go to school to be a teacher...so it's really hard. I also feel that there's too many portfolios and they are usually pretty hard and require a lot of time. I also feel the special education teachers should contact their students a lot more than they do.","I think you guys are awesome.  I always am so impressed with how organized you are.

The teacher confuses her. Plus when the teacher can't get the answer correct on a quick check they shouldn't be teaching my child. So we choose to work on our own and her grades are better for it.","I am disappointed in the alarm status that is pretty much always on one or both of my children's  account. we have constant contact with the teachers and having calls every week is really hard to do at times.","I can't complain, I think you have done your BEST","I believe more Transitional education for not only the Student to understand, but the Parents as well.\nThe last 4 years fly by for students and many are not ready for transition to either college or work force etc.","Continue to allow my son to take advantage of the benefits of a cyber education and enroll in the regular education classes at his skill level until the Special Education Department is overhauled.  Overhaul the Special Education Department.  Train the teachers in Special Education to better understand acceptable, professional behavior.  Enhance the curriculum offered in Special Education to offer more of a variety that meet the needs of the population they are serving.  Offer more than one Math program for students in special Education.   Special Education Department Administrators (Managers and Directors) should work with and not ignore the families that want to form a team with the school.   Remind special Education the meaning of IEP TEAM and not attempt to iimpose a dictatorship attitude without considering the needs of the students.  Special Education should communicate with and respond to the families - falls under increase level of professionalism.  Learn best practices from Regular Education.   The Special Education department as a whole seems overwhelmed.  Similar to Brick and Mortar schools, the Special Education Director should report in to the Regualr Education principals.  Special Education and Regular Education teachers should have more of a knowledge of the classes offered in each department.  Encourage Special Education teachers and staff to communicate, communicate, communicate with families if the Special Ed staff has concerns, etc.  start first by communicating the concerns, etc. with the families.","n/a","Only in the way that if we move, perhaps recommend another online program for the area!?","CCA has been doing fine so far. One son or the other has been enrolled in CCA for 5 of the past 6 years.","Nothing","its already better","Teachers do not seem as responsive this year as they were last year.","I'm not sure thanks for asking.","Nothing I can think of. I always recommend CCA to anyone considering cyber school!","Keep up the good work!","Monitor when my child attends LL, and keep the system updated because her status is, inappropriately, stating she is in or approaching alarm status. Other than this issue, we are happy with the program!","n/a","Not sure at this time.","I think they are doing a good job","The main dissatisfaction I encountered were the courses for my child. She is planning on going to college for English/writing and it would be helpful if CCA would have more courses designed towards creative writing and other English areas.","N/A","Less portfolios and teachers that's experience enough in special education who can deal with an autistic student.","I don't really know.  It has been a frustrating year.  Our family mentor has been very helpful and the home room teacher and guidance counselor have been responsive when we have reached out to them.  The teachers have a lot of projects which are very time consuming.  It seems like there is a lot more work than with some of the other cyber schools.  Once you get behind it is hard to catch up.","My children thrive on teacher contact. I have spoken to a few teacher that have had nothing but positive things to say regarding the new elementary live lesson schedule. Despite the fact that we are cyber schooling, I do not want my child to be computer taught all day long. The comment has been made to me that the lessons are designed so the children can complete them on their own. Just because they can, does that mean that they should? I brought my students to CCA because they were getting more quality time with teachers in live lessons than they would have gotten at a b&amp;m setting. Suddenly, that does not seem to be the case for the 2018/19 school year. I am trying to remain positive and know I will get a sneak peak of the curriculum. Sadly, I looked around at other cyber school and decided that none could compare to the amount of teacher contact that CCA had, or rather will have had. To me it seems that the LC and teacher rolls are being switched. Unfortunately I am having to re-evaluate our schooling options for at least 2 of my CCA students.","Better communication","The pop up adds where a little much, especially during assessments. Also, I didn't like the \"Alarm\" notice on the home page. I feel it was disheartening to see when first logging in. My son is very shy and has a hard time sleeping so much of his work is done in the evening and wasn't able to attend live lessons or have schedule calls with the teachers. Everyone has been pretty understanding and my son has done very well this year in comparison to going to school so  I am grateful for cca.","Wish they offered Dual Enrollment throughout the state. My daughter really wanted to participate but isnt able to since its not offered near us.","Need help with accommodating child during standardized testing.","I would like more social opportunities for my son in our area.  We have not connected with anyone his age in or around where we live (Downingtown)","simplify things and the process of school too much busy work makes it overwhelming for student and parent","By continuously being attentive to the concerns of the parents and the advancement of the students.","listen to suggestions","I think its great","..","No deadlines on lessons.  Ultimately the should be one due date st the end of the school season.  One stark difference between CCA and traditional homeschool is the making periods.  While I see the need for them there should be no permanent zeros. \nBetter mobile site.  I use my phone while she is on computer.  \nDidn't have a family mentor this year? That was nice having more opportunities to talk to someone with more flexible time","everything is great no improvements are needed.","It was a bit disappointing this year that there weren't many functions at the local school office as the Capital Campus was under renovation and the Crums Mill location was not able to be used for gatherings anymore.  I think that we missed out on a lot of social opportunities like movie nights/ game nights and teacher- facilitated trips that we used to have with activities at the Crums Mill location.  I feel as though we were a bit disconnected from a core group of families that used to attend the game nights and other functions.  We were still able to attend many field trips, but it didn't feel the same as the connection we had in previous years.  I am hopeful that the next year there will be more opportunities at the Capital Campus location to interact more with teachers and with other families.  As the teachers were working out of their homes for much of the time, there wasn't the opportunity to meet as much directly at the local office as there was in years past.  I am hopeful this will change for next year too now that the teachers are located at the Capital Campus instead of working out of their homes.  The curriculum this year was also a little frustrating and we look forward to the new changes for next year.","I would like to see a Writing Lab provided to all students.  Some students really struggle with the writing process and I would like to see a Writing Lab available, like the Evening Support Room for students to get the help they need.","Id like information on socialization opportunities.","not have so many profiles","have better options for kids with IEP,teachers who are used to dealing with and understanding them.","Nothing at this time","My son is stressed out a bit that he seem to have too much work.  He loves CCA and being cyber schooled but he works from 9am until 5 pm without a break. English seems to be the problem!","1) special education could be more helpful....I understand that there are laws they need to follow, but sometimes I just need to talk with someone about what would help my child. Maybe even provide some learning coach training in regards to kids that need extra help. My child needs help with executive functioning...it would be so helpful if someone could teach me how to help her with that on a daily basis.\n2) providing more things locally....we are too far away to participate in many of the really cool things that CCA does for their families.\n3) Possibly lessening the load on teachers...the teachers are fabulous, but they are spread so thinly, they can't all develop the rapport with each and every student. My kids enjoy when a teacher really gets to know them.","CCA is awesome the way it is","While my son's 504 plan is followed by all of his teachers, he still sometimes need more time than given to finish assignments.","Periodic hard copy mailings.","Make certain that ALL aspects of the online learning environment, including the LiveLessons rooms, are accessible for students using screen reader technology.  Make certain that all lessons and assessment are accessible to and meaningful for students with visual impairment, including blindness (universal design for learning instead of accommodations and modification). Accessibility of textbooks, activities,  etc.","I cant think of nothing better to improve it.","I think CCA is doing a great job.  I'm excited for next year.  Some things I would change though:  I do NOT like the new attendance policy this year.  Twice I've marked my child \"P\" because we were on a field trip.  The teacher changed it to \"N\" because my student didn't log into Connexus.  Then there were weekends where my student accidentally logged onto Connexus while playing on her laptop and the teacher changed my \"N\" to a \"P\".  I understand some parents may not be truthful about the attendance, but I feel I know better if my student had an educational day or not.  Second thing I'd change is the curriculum.  I know this is happening next year and I am so happy.  Connections is terrible, especially the new LA and Math for elementary.  I'm hoping for good stuff next year.   My third change is having elementary live lessons at different times.  I have always had 2 students in elementary at a time.  Next year I will have a K and 2nd grader.  I find while one is in Live Lesson is a good time to work with my other student.  When both have LL at the same time, I have to make other times to work with the other one on one.  It would be really nice to have one grade have LL at one time and another grade at a different time.","Re-structure the Special Education Program that is in place! Hire teachers and learning support staff with REAL experience with learning disabilities. Stop wasting federal funding! Remove the courses that are irrelevant from the curriculum for the students who need more reading and math assistance! Stop relying on inaccurate software data to do the work that a learning support teacher is trained to do! Hire teachers who are willing to work one on one with students to personally monitor and keep accurate track of the students academic progress. Hire teachers who are willing to go above and beyond for their students!","When my child is in alarm, having better communication with the student.","Provide more career based field trips or summer camps.","time","we have everything we need to be successful at CCA","I think that CCA is doing a great job serving our family. We have a complicated IEP and medical issues and they have made things go smoothly.","Make teachers more available by phone and in person.  I believe there should be more interaction with teachers and students although this is cyber school.  As parents we are part of our child's success in addition to their teachers.  However, I feel there is a disconnect somewhere.  Also more intervention from the teacher's on my child's progress, success or the lack thereof.  Although portfolios are part of the curriculum they should not be all assigned by various teachers at the same time.  This prevents the students from moving on online in their studies and makes them behind causing stress and lack of motivation.  I would like the opportunity to meet my child's teachers at least one time at a back to school night in person at one of the Center's perhaps.","I ass a parent think there was too many portfolios this year. It seemed like they would just get done with 1 and there was another 1. Other than that I have no complaints","CCA given excellent service already. I am so happy. Thank you.","not sure","N/A","They are doing a great job.","I'm pleased.  I like our mentor calling every other week to check in and answer any questions I have.  I can call her anytime with questions.\nEven with this being cyber school, I feel the teachers interactions are super.  They call on the phone also.\nI'd like to see more get togethers with other students. (Social life). Maybe a local middle school activity or dance or game night.  ??","If the teachers would actually attempt the lessons and tests to see how long a lot of them really take, they would understand that they are too long and some contain errors.  The new LiveLesson system (upper grades) makes my kids feel like they don't have a teacher, not all lessons are covered, and they don't know where to find information.","They are doing a great job now couldn't ask for a better schooling for my son.","Get better curriculum!!!!! The set up was absolutely terrible this year! Stop using a PSSA format for testing in language arts. This was horrible for language arts, especially when there were \"select all that apply\" questions. The curriculum last year was far better.","They are doing a great job so far!","Give teachers more flexibility with the curriculum","We have no complaints for CCA.","Na","Nothing can be done better.","There truly is nothing, CCA has a satisfied parent and student.  Thank you.","First - Add an FFA program. FFA is not just farming - it offers so many additional educational opportunities that our students are missing out on. \nSecondly - the attendance policy this year is TERRIBLE -  It  has no real flexibility overall.  We prefer hours to just tracking logins - and Mon-Sun is so unnatural to call a week, especially when the attendance calendar blocks it out Sun -Sat like a normal week. \nThird - Do not place students in enrichment programs without discussing it with the parents.  Your benchmarking was not clear to my IEP students about what aids they can use - then your system \"punished\" them for not using their allowed aids to take the benchmark. \nNext - Lack of \"Education Field Trip\" forms to take days off for educational purposes. My kids are very active in 4-H and if the attended B&amp;M I could fill out a form for their participation in an educational event to be an excused absence. My kids were penalized this year for every event they participated in. They should not have to \"log in\" when at a event participating in 4-H if a B&amp;M student just fills out a form and turns it in. \n","The school is doing an excellent job but the test of language arts and math that have multiple answers do not give partial credit.","I think CCA is doing a great job.","Get more electives for middle school and remove/train the v. p.","CCA needs to fill the gap in for the kids who have IEP's and qualify for the SRA program however  they  are more than capable of doing more than the SRA program offers. The SRA program is really meant for children that are extreme cases where they will need their parents or the state to take care of them as an adult.  Going to only two live lessons a day and filling out a worksheet during LL for the 2 classes is what only a very tiny percent of kids need. There needs to be a program for the children that fall in between SRA and mainstream.","I am completely satisfied with CCA!!! This school is amazing!!","keeping it flexible","We have a lot of tech support issues this year compared to last year. Tech support is not the same in helping as in previous year.","Help me to understand cca alil better my daughter is having alot of problems with math","I feel everything that CCA has to offer is great right now.","Curriculum is confusing and too many different sites and directives. No books for some subjects and not all subjects materials were related to the actual subject.  Those subjects that had books some teacher did not use, was replace by their own confusing curriculum.  This year was very confusing, the online curriculum did not a-line up with the teachers directives to students","High school LL's have been a bit of a change. In all the previous years, the teachers covered the required materials/lessons in the LL's themselves. Now it is expected to read ALL the materials and then the LL's are extra or somewhat supplementary to the lessons, with the exception of Math and English.  As a special needs parent, with a son who is a visual learner- this has been very difficult to pick up the reigns to cover most of the material on his own.  I understand as the children get older, more responsibility must be placed on them, the reading requirements are quite difficult to complete in a timely manner, with my special needs son. He responds more and understands more, when the teacher goes over the material. US History and Earth Science has been a challenge this year, compared to previous years.","h","I can't think of anything right now.","idk","At the beginning of the school year, I sent the elementary principal a webmail requesting a phone call about a concern.

Many times throughout the school year we've had difficulty aligning live lesson material with book material. This is especially difficult when a child is \"behind\" and is therefore not attending the live lessons, but watching them at a later date. Often, live lessons aren't labeled in a way that is accessible. Similarly, lesson materials should have some kind of label that corresponds to book materials. For example, in science, online lessons have Units and Lessons, but the science textbooks are organized differently.

At most field trips parents are now talking about whether they will be staying at CCA and what are better options out there. I gave CCA such a high ranking this year based on the services we are getting outside of CCA. It's really too bad CCA use to be outstanding and it's now average overall. The parents that left CCA last year and have gone to PA Cyber are much happier. I think its only a matter of time you will be losing more families.

I am back to trying to piecemeal a social life for my autistic son to help him survive in this social world. CCA use to help be a vibrant partner in that process.

we came to CCA we truly came looking for help and healing . We had some really bad experiences both with other students and faculty .  What we found with CCA was amazing and caring support both from teachers and staff . We found many kind and wonderful and intelligent students ready to show they had a lot to offer if given the chance . As CCA has shown time and again they care . One thing I would like to see in addition to the winter semi formal I would love to see a prom .",null,null,"I love the fact that CCA teaches my son curriculum that he needs for life not teach him to take the state tests so he can get a good grade for more funding for the school.",null,"I feel there should be a deadline for each lesson. After that the student should be given a zero. Real life doesn't give extensions.",null,"Administration careless.  Teachers great, but have time cut because of admin.  Admin never contacts parents or children","the teachers do a wonderful job","your address book or directory for school staff, etc. is not very user friendly.  If I need to speak with staff/administration other than a teacher I find it time consuming to find the right person to e-mail.",null,null,null,null,null,null,"All of my daughters teachers are fabulous and have always been helpful.

They love the school and the flexibility that the school provides.  They are working harder now then they have ever before, but it is ok since they are no longer being bullied they are getting more out of academics.  They love the teachers and the teachers are so helpful to them.","Elementary has been something of an adjustment.  Middle school has been an easier adjustment.  We have met some AMAZING teachers!  Ms. Rux, and Mr. Gross are amazing!!!!!!!!","This is our second year of working wMy son had a horrible teacher last year that was never available, not did she call anyone back...EVER!  This year the teachers at least call back, however it is a week later. A week later, I tend to not remember what the problem was in the first place.",null,null,"Make the system more User Friendly.\n\nAnd possibly even, take a good look at the courses. There's an opportunity, with proper organization, to optimize the learning experience with \"Cross-Over\" projects/assignments.",null,null,null,null,null,null,"Overall I am extremely pleased with CCA this year. We had a few bumps in the road at the beginning of the year with my sons IEP. His file was misplaced; he was put in gifted courses, then general education for all 4 main courses, and then finally put into the 180 courses for math and reading. \nCCA has met my daughters education needs by allowing her to work at her own pace and advance through 1st and 2nd grade quickly. She is now in 3rd and being challenged by the curriculum and thriving! \nAs great as CCA is a few things were difficult this year, the first being field trips. It was frustrating to find out that I couldnt pay for a 2nd field trip myself and then find out later that the field trip was not full to begin with. If we are willing to pay for a trip on our own and not cost the school anything, why would you turn students away? After all the complaining from other families that they couldnt get into field trips because they were all filled up, my children have not been on 1 field trip that was at its max this year. \nAlso, I find it frustrating my daughters third grade teacher does not send out  an update of what is being covered in class and what needs to be covered on her own or with a learning coach. For example, the 3B, Unit 2, lessons 1-5, the story Sukis Kimono teaches about editorials. The portfolio due on day 4 -instructs the students to write an editorial on why they think it is important to be yourself. My daughter watched the lessons but the teacher never went over any aspects of an editorial, even though the assessments 1-4 ask questions about an editorial. The elementary live lessons often times seem to only go over the stories and grammar, leaving out the extra details that are covered on assessments. It would be nice if they teacher mention these things when sending out a weekly email. Such as, please read or please watch the video in lesson 2, page 3 titled., I will not be covering this in lesson. \nThis issue makes me wonder if the teachers are even looking at the assessments. Another example Math 3B, Unit 2, lesson 1 is a practice review of basically improper fractions. Improper fractions were brought up briefly in the online lesson. I was shocked at the review because the problems did not even compare to the 2 examples given in the lesson. When I asked the teacher about it she had to look at the practice review to see what I was talking about. She was shocked that is what the practice review was on. Why are the teachers not going through the lesson assessments to see what the questions are? They are the teachers; it is their job to know what our students are being graded on. I cant tell you how many times I have had to go back to a teacher and ask, Why was this not addressed in class? Improper fractions are a big deal for 3rd grade. \n\nLike I said, I am overall please with CCA but there are a few things that need improved to make the students lessons time efficient. I wasted 20 minutes today trying to figure out why my daughter couldnt answer assessment questions on editorials only to find that her teacher never covered the topic. \n","Overall our experience with CCA has been great. I am glad that we broke from Connections Education to make changes that will help our students become better learners. Thank you! I am looking forward to a new LMS, I find the Connexus system time consuming and frustrating. It takes multiple clicks to get a desired location. A hover system or drop down menu might work and be easier.","My family hasn't been with the school long but what we have done so far I am very happy with the progress and the way things are done.","Some teachers take too long to grade.

The education of my girls was effected greatly.  I enrolled them in PACyber since many other parents were doing the same.  After 2 years I was unhappy with the experience due to the feeling that the instructors were \"removed\" from the students.    We had an Instructional Supervisor that would act as mediator for me and my children with their teachers. Several times I had to wait for over a week to get any feedback to our questions.  I felt that my girls were not learning as I would like.  \nWhen I heard about CCA, I did a lot of homework and reading.  Also, I met with other mothers whose children attended CCA.

Our younger daughter (4th) struggled this year but that was more personal reasons and not completely understanding what cyber school would look like. She had an idea of what she thought it would be but quickly realized it was different than she thought. But that was more a transitioning on our part. Besides that we have enjoyed being part of the CCA family this year. I feel that with our older daughter (8th) the transition was extremely smooth and positive. She has enjoyed all of her classes and teachers.",null,"I would just repeat my other comment on having more options of curriculum. When I first started out in this world of homeschooling with a cyber school, PA Cyber had 2 choices of curriculum to choose from. And, my local school district actually also offers K12 and Connections as 2 choices for curriculum. However, they weren't as connected as CCA has been with the staff and contact-ease, so that is why we have stayed with CCA. I would LOVE to have this same communication with the teachers, but use the K12 program and a supplemental program for Microsoft software. Making the music optional would be even more perfect as I absolutely think there could be MANY changes to the songs and the programming for that part of the K12 curriculum. Just simply placing the ability to make the songs slower would help teach the sounds and theory that they are trying to teach. If you would like to talk more with me about my opinions, I could talk forever about things I would love to see in a curriculum. Seeing from the point-of-view of someone with 6 kids, 3 in your school, 1 in another school and having a kindergartener starting next year, I have a great perspective. Please contact me if you wish. 717-859-3193 Jaclyn","Well, I said quite a bit in the last question. I would mention that the classes with the teachers take up a lot of time with the kids and my son especially, in 8th grade, hasn't always had enough time to get all his work done. I think it's important to make those classes solely content based. I have heard that they are that way in high school, but I don't understand why they wouldn't be that way in Middle School as well. I think that some students can handle the work load after classes (my daughter being one of the them), but other students (like my 8th grade son) can not and it's a struggle sometimes to keep him caught up with his planner lessons when he has class several hours a day on other points of interest other than the content.\n\nThe other thing I feel like I need to mention is that I don't understand why my kids learn the same thing every year in Science especially. Several times this year, my 4th, 6th and 8th grader were all working on the same thing. Now, of course, the information was a little different comparing the grades, but initially it looks like they are always learning the same things. There is a lot of science in the world. I would have thought that the curriculum writers could come up with other things to teach our children. Instead, it sometimes appears that the curriculum is the same, but with additions for the older grades. It just comes across as lazy. Sorry to be blunt, but that was my first thought when we started seeing this trend the first year we started. I do wish there was more to the science curriculum. It gets a little boring having to the learn the parts of a plant and how they grow, year after year after year.",null,null,null,"For our first year with CCA we have had a very successful year.  I attended public b&amp;m schools growing up and I taught in b&amp;m schools, so cyberschool was a major paradigm shift for me.

The students need to know that their teachers care about them and want to see them succeed.  That's a little harder when in a cyber environment, but it can be done.  When my kids were doing cyber school during elementary years they always spoke with their teacher each month.  That personal connection means a lot, and the high school students are missing out on that.\n\nI had sent webmails to two different teachers that my daughter has had during high school years and did not receive any response for quite awhile.  The one teacher did not ever get back to me and that was after sending 3 different webmails over a period of 6 weeks.  My daughter also sent 2 webmails to that same teacher and he never responded to her either.  I finally had to get a guidance counselor involved.  It's not acceptable.

That can be challenging.  The teachers all seem very knowledgeable, however, that does not always translate through \"cyber teaching\" as well.  Teachers do not always know when/if a student is struggling, because students don't have opportunities for a one-on-one conversation with the teachers.  I feel that as much as it may be a time constraint, it would be greatly effective for each teacher to speak at least one time every other month with the high school students. . . . via phone call, or even in a cyber classroom - but a one-on-one verbal conversation - not via chat!

For meaningful instrumental experiences the school should get memberships in musical education groups like LLMEA, where students can prepare challenging pieces and competitively audition to be a member of regional orchestras, working their way up as far as Nationals.

For several weeks she had no teacher. Luckily she finally got a new teacher but not until after school was already in session. The principle should have emailed all of these new students and told us what was going on. While we didn't need to know if the teacher left or was being reassigned, we needed to know that \"Hey, we are making changes and please be patient with us.\" Since we have no control over the times of our kids online teachers lessons (teachers choice) we should be informed as soon as possible to make our own plans.

She sent an email and wrote in it that she would know who was reading her messages from those not reading, by those that tried to submit their completed port anyway.

That's not what we were told when we enrolled at CCA. We were assured that our kids could work at their own pace and finish early if they were so inclined. Teachers need to know their curriculum before they begin the school year and post changes in a timely manner to the message board.

We were very skeptical about our daughter doing her school work from home. We heard all the horror stories and very few success stories so, of course we were very uncomfortable about this choice to go cyber. There were many other reasons as well. All the trouble we were having at the time with our daughter in an alternative school, made going cyber harder but our only choice. Honestly we were at our wits end when we decided that cyber school was our last hope for our daughter to get an education and we where not sure if the education she was going to receive was going to be grade level. She wasn't getting her grade level of education either. Our daughter has thought long and hard about what she want's to do with her life after high school and that require's her to go to a four year college to be able to get into the carrier of her choice. After talking with a lot of the faculty, researching CCA and comparing CCA to other cyber school's we started to become comfortable with the idea of home schooling. Well I can say I did not expect all that CCA has to offer. The resources and strive for higher education is remarkable, and the education that she is getting is fantastic. Our daughter thought she wasn't smart enough to return to what she called a normal education but, once she became comfortable with everything she realized that she was just as normal as anyone else. Thanks to CCA our daughter's future not just in her eyes, but in our eyes as well, looks to be a hole lot brighter. We can't thank the faculty and staff of CCA enough.

When we've had doctors appointments or even field trips my son falls so far behind way too quickly and it takes him weeks to catch up again from one day off.  We aren't doing any more field trips this school year because of the heavy workload &amp; LL schedule. Also, CCA added PE to his spring schedule without okaying it with us &amp; it is a ton of extra work for a silly PE credit. Oh and changed his Health teacher without our say and now he has much worse health teacher. \nOn the positive side we love many of his teachers. Mrs. Bernstein for algebra A++. Mr Mariano for biology a++. Mrs. Schmidt for English A++. Mr conigliaro for history is excellent teacher but he gets frustrated with the kids and gets very negative &amp; judgemental. While my child has not been the object of his negative remarks some of it could be humiliating for the kids who it is directed at. Plus he doesn't send emails to parents just kids so I cannot keep track of changes &amp; announcements. Then he gets upset with students for not following directions &amp; reading his emails, etc. \nOverall it's CCA is inconsistent. Yes it has great teachers. Curriculum has way too much meaningless busy work. The CCA office staff are hit or miss. Some staff are great while others don't answer emails or have sub par communication skills on phone.

I was surprised that two teachers just sat sharing youtube videos. I am a dancer myself so it wasn't what we expected. That's OK, but I think the name should be reconsidered. I felt our teacher was very condescending at times. If she expects me to call her MISS in one on one interactions I expect the same courtesy. During testing times I think the offer of a visit to a local office should be suggested to inner city families who don't drive. We had zero connection with any of the children in our son's class. Maybe a fun cam session would be good? Informal and get to know you. We loved Ms. Stevenson and her class on social interaction. However, we just found out about it two weeks ago. I think the lessons could be more fluid. For example, we had a project about making a spring cultural twig to be put outside March 1. But the lesson is in January. There was a lesson on the olden days and on the next page after the intro there was a photo discussion of a little girl falling down on ice skates. I think your topics are great, but the fluidity is off. I was disappointed that during an election year the voting process was almost entirely ignored. It can be done in a neutral, non-biased way. Nickelodeon's website was great for inspiration. Thank you for hearing my concerns. I haven't had a chance to air them, especially with the void I feel between my son's teacher and myself.","very good year",null,"I also prefer the previous technical support than the one that is now provided, along with the hours that helped a great deal.",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"connections academy is the perfect school for the student who have par time job because they do not have to be present on live lesson since the teacher is always recording the lesson to catch up on latter.",null,null,"The Grade Book frightens me.

There was so much more flexibility and the work load was manageable.  The Calvert Curriculum was superior to the Pearson Curriculum, in our opinion.  The workload has become progressively more and more restrictive to the point of excessive and unreasonable.  The curriculum should be revised and revamped and the students should not have to put in more than 6 hours to complete their workload and maintain excellent grades.  The workload is oppressive and ridiculous and our family is not too happy at this point.  However, since Karisma is now in the 10th Grade, it is difficult to transition her to a brick and mortar school, since this is the only school that she has ever attended since Kindergarten.\n\nOn the other hand, the teachers are top notch.

They should also highlight their curriculum grading especially when it is outside the norm like the Spanish class. Most classes on average have 3 portfolios per semester, so they should be emphasizing these sorts of things so the students get the importance of a particular assignment.  And when students are reaching out they should demonstrate a greater measure of connecting with the student.  I was thoroughly disappointed with Mrs. Bueno and the way she was so passive and really missed an opportunity to serve my daughter.  I would want her superior to get this message and help her to explain at the beginning of class as well as during the class that goes over the portfolio that it is the only one and that it carries a lot of weight.  Most likely whatever you get on the portfolio will end up being the grade.  She never did this during any of her classes and I think it puts the student at a disadvantage especially since there is only one portfolio assignment.",null,"My one disappointment with the curriculum would be the lack of reading classic literature/full books rather than selections.

I create simple tech \"assignments\" in their place in minutes that make more sense and are less time eaters.  Kids enjoy my lessons, but hate the school lessons.  But I do see the value in having technology and am glad it is a regular class.  You may consider letting student take every other year though after their first year, as it is quite repetitive.\n\nI do like the school quite a bit, it's just that as a learning coach to three, two with special needs, I am tied to the classroom for about 10 hours a day, sometimes much longer.

We found this year (possibly due to the growth and the break from Connections Academy), a bit more challenging that in past years. Mostly due to what the teachers are expecting. In the 7th grade, some teachers do NOT want to you to work ahead and you (ie my student) have to really pay attention to what the teachers are saying as you get docked for doing the work ahead of time or miss out on the changes (changes aren't announced until LL and then not updated on the BB or within the lesson). It makes working independently difficult and that is one of the draws to CCA.

If we had to pay for the time there with everyone it would still be worth it to us. To omit it without the option of deferring the cost on the parents was harsh cold and seemed a bit unconcerning... like we no longer mattered to CCA only the bottom line mattered. As a parent I would gladly pay for our tickets to that event. Do not dismiss the event so heartlessly when it meant so much to so many.","I love my experience with CCA. My daughter loves it.

It's hard to do AP bio correctly w/o the labs.  I know you have a mobile classroom but making some of the events is hard when you live in one area and the mobile classroom is 1-2 hours drive away.

Many CTs go to the Great Start (GS) Sessions but still do not clearly understand their role and responsibility as a CT. The families that I mentor have said or have done the following:  At the GS sessions, they are presented too much information at once.  They feel overwhelmed and they do not remember what is being said.  (The CCA How To Guide should be given out at the GS sessions)  Many CTs have a false sense of \"knowing everything\" and are not open to help or advise.  Many do not go to LL, communicate with teachers or Family Mentors.  Often, they call me up in a panic when they are in alarm or being kicked out of CCA.","Some of the teachers need to be friendlier at Field Trips and school events.  Some teachers need to post their LL schedule and have it coordinate with the lessons better. We need a branch office in the Lehigh Valley.  We need more field trips and social events. I've found that they build school loyalty and families learn from each other.\n\nAs a 2nd year Family Mentor, I think that we have to market CCA better and make it clearer what CTs are expected to do.  Many of them are still clueless after going to the Great Start Sessions or are getting misinformation there.  It has been more work this year to get new families started and understanding that they have to be an active participant in their child's education. They are under the impression that they just can stick their child in front of the computer.  They think that helping them, communicating with CCA Staff, taking attendance or marking lessons complete are optional.",null,"Love CCA. The curriculum is excellent. My only feedback would be that some of the Social Studies Unit tests should be broken down.

I always tell my kids.  If you ask an opinion question, there are NO wrong answers.  Not all things being taught are accurate, but again, this gives me an opportunity to give my kids experience on researching and reading other experts on subjects so they can look at things more objectively and make their own personal opinions on them.","Keep up the good work CCA!",null,"Our experience at CCA over the past 4 years has been very positive.  We have had mostly good teachers and a few excellent ones.  We have found most teachers easy to work with.  The work is rigorous and balancing live lessons and the daily coursework is challenging.  In the first year my student attended all the live lessons and much less now.  I've also noticed that live lessons have gotten longer, a full hour.  I think 30-40 minutes or less is plenty, and more students might attend.  The prospect of having 5 1-hour live lessons in a day means the student has no time left to get any other course work done.  The choice to go back to the public school was based on the need to have more interaction with students his age, and not on academics.","CCA has a high quality of wonderful teachers and staff.  Always willing to help and go the extra mile for my child.  My daughter has mental health issues, and CCA has made her feel welcome and help ease her anxiety towards school.",null,"We love it!

It's a great facility but underutilized for the students and families. Just even simple things like a weekly board game day for the kids to socialize, or movie nights such as the ones offered in the Harrisburg office. The pond outside could be used for pond studies, etc. Again, these activities don't have to be elaborate or costly, but opportunities for our students to work and play together. We'd also like to see the paid field trips, with spaces available at the time of the outing, opened to families that may have already attended their one monthly paid field trip. This year, many field trips have been under attended, or even cancelled, due to lack of sign up, when there are families that would be glad to assume the cost and go. Our CCA experience was better when we could attend more field trips. Our student saw her schoolmates more frequently and benefitted from the varied field trip experiences. Additionally, there need to be more free field trips and meet-ups. Utilizing the Andreas facility could be one solution to the need for increased free social and academic field days.",null,null,"n/a","For our child, one of five, cyber school was the perfect fit","I am very pleased with his education.

They are a fantastic group of educators.","I wrote it all in the last box. Have one 2012 Grad with CCA, one Grad for 2016 with CCA and hopefully our last child will graduate in 2021 with Connections Academy.","We really enjoy the field trips.  I was disappointed as to how they were handled this year.  I would like to be able to have my child attend more paid field trips than 1 per month, even if I have to pay out of pocket for the additional trips.  Socialization is very important.  Cutting back on the trips has made this an issue.  I also think that there should be more review incorporated in the lessons.  I love the curriculum, but I sometimes feel that it is too fast, and the students are not retaining information because of this.  I am impressed with the curriculum.  When we chose an online school, I thought I would have to supplement the curriculum, but that isn't the case with CCA.","CCA has been a saint for us. Our daughter was not responding well to Math in her brick and mortar school.  She loved her friends and the socialization of brick and mortar schools however she was failing math but excelled in all other subjects. We were told continuously that we should consider holding her back a grade because of her math skills yet she excelled in everything else. After sitting with the Principal, Guidance Counselor and Teacher, we discussed holding her back and the possibility of putting her on ADD medication. I was furious yet stayed composed and explained that ADD medicine is for children/adults that have difficulties paying attention, not for the lack of understanding in one subject.  That would hardly be a reason to put a child on ADD medicine. After that meeting, I informed the school, that we would be showing her how to compete math the way she comprehends it. She was doing this before and getting the answers correct however since it was different from the way the curriculum showed to get the answer, the teachers were marking them incorrect. She obviously learns differently in math than how they were teaching yet was getting the same (correct) answer. After this continued and the constant communication that we should consider holding her back so that she can repeat and understand math better, we began looking for alternatives. We found many different charter and virtual schools however CCA stood out to us by a long shot. We enrolled her and her younger brother in CCA, after extensive research, and she has excelled ever since.  She made honor roll within her first year of school and has been \"on top of the world\" ever since. She still has difficulties in math however with the extra math help provided by CCA, taped live lessons that she can re-watch in the areas she finds more difficult and wonderful assistance from the teachers, she maintains a B average in math alone. All other courses she is A and A+. She and we, as parents, couldn't be more proud of her and her development. I know everyday my children are safe, respectful, confident, intelligent and have the best support from CCA that they need for their future. Had it not been for the guidance and support of CCA, my daughter would most likely have been put on anti-depressants for a lack of self-esteem and depression, ADD medications because they felt she wasn't paying attention and held back a grade. \n\nMy husband and I laugh sometimes at others that tell us \"you are ruining your children's future by putting them in charter schools\". We simply reply, \"if ruining our children's lives by providing them the best education, support, guidance, opportunities for Division I colleges/universities all while building a strong foundation, confidence within themselves is ruining their lives, then we are comfortable with that. Our children's curriculum is more difficult and intense than the average brick and mortar school yet our children now excel in all of their courses. Not because they're easier, to the contrary, but because they have the ability to review what they need to work on and quickly go through what they already know. They have teachers that are available to help them understand the questions, not push them through because it may hold up the class. Ruining our children's lives would have been ignoring the issues, like so many do, and followed what everyone thought was the right way to educate because that's the way it's always been done.  Virtual schools are the way of the future, it's why universities are offering so many classes virtually. Our children will be more ready for their future because of what they have learned at CCA and been instilled with from a moral and respectful home.\"\n\nSo in summary, thank you CCA. Thank you for allowing my daughter to be the confident, beautiful, intelligent and strong child she always has been. She glows everyday with happiness and walks tall due to her grades and positive responses from her teachers. Her younger brother sees this everyday and wants to walks in those same footprints of a proud sibling.

I have called multiple times about it but nothing is ever done to fix it.  I was told they know this is a problem and are working on it.  It is not encouraging to see a big, mean, frowning face everyday that you log in, knowing full well your child has been working and gets good grades.

Our CCA grad of 2013, our daughter Sarah, went on to complete Escoffier Online Culinary Institute without a problem. She is certified in Culinary Arts and Baking/Pastry. She found the switch from CCA to another online school easy. Zechariah was at CCA from grades 6-8. However, he had to go into the brick school for high school, due to the very active daily music schedule at that high school. He always said that CCA did well in teaching him the 5 paragraph - essay format. He found writing to be no trouble in high school, taking that knowledge with him. He is currently a scholarship student at Moravian College, majoring in Music Tech/Audio Recording/Jazz Sax and possibly accounting or business. \nWe are a fan of CCA and continue to be so. When our son passes away some years back in 2003, the teachers, staff were very supportive. Also, our daughter Sarah was hospitalized also a few years back.

My daughter is a very motivated student, who does have to work hard, but when she does, she does very well.  I'd like to see her be able to go faster in the areas she feels she excels in and likes (like math) as she has expressed wanting to do so.  She LOVES learning Sign Language.  She didn't like Elementary Spanish as much because while she wanted to learn the language, she didn't want to have to learn history and culture in the same class.  (She already takes Social Studies and it is not her favorite.)  I think You should break out the culture of Spain and Spanish speaking countries from learning the language.  Because of this mix, she does not want to take the next class in Spanish, which is unfortunate because at some point (later), I will possibly have to insist she learn Spanish.  Hopefully later there will be language learning separate from history/culture.

One of our daughter's teachers expected assignments to be turned in the day they were do and would take off points if they were not turned in that day - that's tough with our schedule and caused anxiety for our A student. Second, our daughter received a new honors English teacher after the first semester and this woman was lost. She had no idea how to use the live lessons and chat boxes, her message boards were very confusing and her lessons were not up to par. It seemed like she had no idea how she was supposed to be functioning as a cyber teacher.

My son's grades are better (he has a 97 overall up about grade 5 points from regular school) and I do not have to deal with behavior issues from ADHD, but the downside is that he misses the social aspect at school. He is torn about continuing, he likes the flexibility and doing what he wants during breaks at home but he is definitely lonely because the other CCA students we have met are 30-40 minutes away.",null,null,null,"teachers have been very accommodating.","n/a",null,"I wish that there was a better gifted or accelerated program.   It is my opinion that the 5th grade curriculum was easier than the 4th grade curriculum.  The curriculum should be getting more difficult to prepare students for Middle School and High School not easier.   My son was often bored this past year.   When looking into the gifted program for him I found that is wasn't more enriching. It was only more busy work.  The gifted math program only skips the student ahead a year in math.  How can you skip a whole year of Math? Math builds on prior knowledge.   These are areas that I think CCA needs to improve upon.    Also, most or the teachers we have had with CCA have been excellent.  They have always exceeded our expectations.  However this year my son's Science/SS teacher left us feeling frustrated.  He did the bare minimum that was required of him.  His live lessons consisted of showing the videos that were already in the lessons.  His reviews were copied from somewhere else and often didn't even coincide with the curriculum.    It seemed like his heart was not in teaching.  I look at a teacher as a service industry.  They are helping to shape our future.  If a teacher is not interested in inspiring and helping students learn then teaching is not the right profession for them in my opinion.       All this being said,  CCA has been a wonderful experience for my son before this point.  I really appreciate the flexibility and the opportunities that is gives students.  It teaches students to be free thinking citizens instead of just learning for a test.  CCA allows students to grow both academically and as a person.","CCA lacks SUPPORT, COMMUNICATION, and EDUCATION. Don't ignore.  The quality of the curriculum has tanked. Too many errors in lessons.

It turned his life around as far as how he felt about school. His old school, although I am told it is a good school, was far from student oriented. They seemed to allow the kids to take over and it wasn't about the learning anymore. They just passed the kids through never noticing who was struggling or who may have been in crisis. I love that this school puts all the kids on even footing. There are no \"cliques\" to contend with, that gets in the way of learning. My son was an A student until high school and his school paid no notice that his grades were slipping. No one asked why? We found CCA and he immediately thrived. He still has all his school friends and he is very well rounded, just now he can focus on himself and not all the petty bologna that goes on in a school that is out of control. From the first day CCA has caught hi attention. He has no trouble with the lessons and can work on his own or ask for help from anyone of his teachers. They are all willing to help. And by the way they all have the best attitudes and personalities. He is going to graduate in June and I know when he walks up to get his diploma he will be proud to say he graduated from CCA. So will his Father and myself. By the way I tell all my friends to check out your school, especially if their child is having any issues with the brick and mortar school they attend. From a learning coach point of view, this has been a great experience for myself as well. I have been so proud and honored that he turns to me to help him if he has a question about his assignments.

The Snap and Read Universal program that helps read his lessons to him has created an independent work atmosphere for him to step out on his own.

At the same time, CCA provides a comprehensive support system of parents, teachers, administrators, and other staff who ensure that the learning coaches are never alone and the students are never isolated.

They responded to WebMails promptly, answered calls, and updated students  w/ needed info. This yr, that responsiveness really lacked in the HS team of teachers. The HS teachers are not the best at answering phone calls and WebMails (same w/ HS administration). Been times where my son has sent a WebMail to one of his teachers and it took them a wk to respond, while some of them dont answer at all. Hard to reach the teachers by phone too. Disappointed, as last yr was quite the contrary! Teachers were good at letting the kiddos know about whats going on. Student is expected to keep an open line of communication and teachers seem to have lacked that yr. Would really encourage teachers were better trained on grading. Understood grading styles vary, but sometimes its just ridiculous. Some teachers create their own expectations for assessments, but when you read how they graded my sons work and compare it to the expectations outlined, its clear that his work wasnt even compared to the expectations. PLEASE encourage the teachers to make a CLEAR grading rubric for their assessments and FOLLOW IT for each assessment. Also, some teachers dont understand circumstances my son has been in. Some seem to forget that we are real people and have real lives and stuff happens that doesnt always let us stay on top of all the work and consequently not letting us do everything as well as expected. Have suffered deaths in the family and have been expected to continue working as normal. In B&amp;M school, a student would be excused from work that he missed in class (I know as I have a son in B&amp;M school excused of work when he was at a funeral). Please encourage your teachers to understand that we are not just recipients of schoolwork...we have real lives that make us get away from that occasionally.",null,"Last year we had so many field trips, this year there was a cut due to financial problems and  this provides the children to meeting other CCA students.",null,null,"I would like to say how wonderful I think my sons teachers are.  I have to give Ms. Janine Simek huge props for helping me so much when we started with CCA in January.  She was such a huge help.  I constantly had questions for her on navigating around the CCA site and about so many other things. (I still do!)  She always answered my questions timely and thoroughly and I honestly don't know what I would have done without her as my sons homeroom teacher.  She was wonderful in Pre-Algebra also.  Always willing to help.  I can't thank her enough.  Mrs. Saul and Ms. Milam are wonderful too.  So willing to help in any way possible.  I can't thank them enough.  You have a wonderful group of teachers.  If we decide to attend CCA in the fall I hope the 9th grade teachers are just as wonderful as the 8th grade teachers.  If I could give them a raise I would!!!!!",null,"Not everyone in 10th/11th grade is ready for college work.

She is no longer crying at the long lessons that she can not retain.  When she works she does her very best.  She has come so far and is doing better then her older sibling.  Although both students are in different schools they have the same curriculum provider, the student in your school can actually read better then her older sibling, she can answer more Science and SS questions then her sibling.  She is empowered to take on the world.  However she is still a kid and finding motivation to keep her moving some days is not easy.  Some positive rewards or recognition from teachers and the school would be helpful.",null,"Our first year was last year and I had many wonderful experiences. This year has not been as great. Mid-year teacher change that did not go very well. Lack of communication from current teacher. This year, teacher's are pushing quarter progress to be at a certain point and giving temporary zeros to students if they are behind in a subject. We picked CCA for the full semester flexibility to get work done and move at our own pace. Certainly not happy with having pressure put on an 8 year old child who needs extra time with language arts, especially since it is also in his IEP to have that extended time for portfolios.

You started out as a great school and I was around to say that my children were students at CCA.

Before we came to CCA my son would not even write on paper now my son is writing 1 to 5 paragraph sentences all thanks to everyone that has been working with my son. Keep up the great work CCA!!","The only thing I regret in my life is not listening to my daughter when she first asked me to pull her out of her b&amp;m and allow her to attend CCA for her education.

CCA taught her that year 1.","CCA really helped my students when they struggle and needed to get an IEP and the teachers follow it in order to help my students","I have been very happy with program","My daughter understood that she owned her education immediately when she chose to start CCA.

The teachers are all amazing and always willing to work with a student when they need help understanding a topic or needs clarification on portfolio assignments.  Our experience with the 3rd grade GT program has been phenomenal! Mrs. Howard has given those students exciting ways to understand topics, encourages \"Genius Hour\" where students get to share with the class topics they research on their own, and engages the children to think beyond the textbook.  My son has thoroughly enjoyed having her for a teacher.  My hope is this same innovative way of thinking continues forward for these GT students.  We also love how the teachers in the 6th grade have moved away from using textbooks while teaching and have provided all the teaching a student needs to go right from Live Lesson to an assessment; especially with Mr. Bennett in Math; his way of teaching math is so effective. Mr. McMahon also goes beyond content lessons to provide \"Hands On\" lessons which enhances the topic currently being discussed. I love how my daughter can leave any of the \"Green Team\" teachers live lessons and move right to the assessments with full understanding of the content within the lessons.","We like that our students are getting an education that is far better than that which they would be getting from the local school district.

Next year, I am truly worried about how he will do.  Like I said, he shuts down when he becomes frustrated and if he doesn't understand something, he gets frustrated.  A lot of the concepts, and the pace of the curriculum, I am afraid might be too much.

I understand quizzes and tests need to be done in order, but many of the other assessments require some extra guidance by the learning coach. When that extra guidance isn't immediately available to the student, they cannot move on without submitting these.  I think they should be able to move to the next lesson and maybe just have a certain window of time in which these need to be turned in.","I think the field trip planners have to large of areas. This is a problem for my family, as we live far away from any big cities. I see that more populated areas always have a lot of things going on for the students to get together. But up north here, there are very few activities to meet other families. I understand this is because of the rural area we live in, but it is a major issue for those of us in this situation. It would be nice if CCA was at least able to somehow \"Connect the Families\" in these area.

She was not helpful.  She would not explain her reasoning for grades she gave.  My child could not grow, nor learn, and ended up distrusting every teacher in that subject each year afterwards.  This year he finally got over that...pretty much anyhow.  That teacher did call me at the end of that school year, apologized and said she hoped we would return the following year.  We have no ill thoughts toward her and hold no bitterness.  I have seen her a few times since, and we have had good conversations.

I've also spoken with other parents  who have had the same experience with this teacher.   She was however, a bit better with the last phone call.  She has marked/taken points away on assignments, when I feel she should not have since her instructions were not clear.   She took away points for not citing a paper that was cited.

I can understand being busy, but I feel it is very important that a teacher respond to a parent within 24 hours.  If a question is asked of a teacher and the teacher is not sure how to answer it, I recommend  that  a teacher should acknowledge the parents concern and get back to them later.   I also have an issue with not having quizzes, test and portfolios graded in a timely manner.  Some times weeks, or , for a portfolio, a month.

We originally wanted to go with CCA however to keep enrolled in Vo-Tech we had to use another Cyber.  CCA provides more structure and hands on learning than the other Cyber.

If we don't encourage them to work ahead, they are bored and we find ourselves simply \"filling time\" to make up the 28 required hours. It seems to me that if a student is getting straight A's in their classes, that the hour requirement should be removed (yes, I know this is a state requirement, but it's still frustrating).\n\nI think that teachers should NOT be allowed to give extra credit to students.\n\nWe have appreciated how some teachers allow our students to correct missed problems on tests/quizzes and earn back some of the points missed.","I was worried at first about the transition to online course work but my child really enjoys the live lessons and feels connected to his teachers, they are a wonderful group of people.

But the curriculum for first grade is a little too much. My daughter struggles with reading and I love that there are programs like I-ready and reading eggs but the other subjects especially the portfolios makes it hard to concentrate on just reading.

I understand wanting to introduce them to this but when a kid is struggling with reading and writing this definitely doesn't help. Also some of the science portfolios can be a lot too.

My elementary school-aged child finds the curriculum tediously boring. I find the same thing with it. The issues we've had in high school have been outlined in the previous slide, namely issues with a specific teacher or two that are definitely NOT up to CCA standards. CCA typically has wonderful teachers, but this one in particular is lacking, and I don't see that anything is ever addressed, which is why I mentioned little to no oversight. Obviously I can't be certain that nothing is done with this teacher, but I do know that nothing changes with this teacher, which leads me to that belief.","Please know that we absolutely love the school.  We are so incredibly thankful for the quality of staff, teachers, administration, and overall experience that your school provides.  You have given us the springboard to instill a love of learning that had been missing in our children from attending a brick and mortar school.  You have made learning fun again for them.  Your teachers are encouraging and willing to work above and beyond what more could you ask for?  Thank you so much for all you do.","Like I said in the last category, we used to love CCA, and I would tell everyone about what a great school it was.  But now, we would not recommend it to anyone.  I honestly and sadly feel that the school grew to fast and is still trying to grow even more, but you have lost the knack for really satisfying families.  There are really too many things that have happen over the last couple of years that have soured our experience with CCA, for me to list here,  But please remember you are affecting the futures of these young people.

I don't mind the changes that were made this year in regards to having to chose just 1 paid field trip a month.  I felt like the free field trips were lacking though.  Last year, our field trip coordinator had several \"teaching\" field trips where we met in a community center and the kids learned a science lesson with their teachers.  These were some of my kids favorite field trips.\n\nMy other thought about field trips that pertains to the way things were done this year is I have received a couple webmails from my field trip coordinator this year that there are still openings for a field trip.

I don't remember exactly how many pages but at least 5 pages with just 2 lessons to get it done in. \n\n5th grade - huge SS portfolio, on top of a bunch of LA writing portfolios, on top of a book report, don't you think that's too much?  \n\n4th and 5th grade - why can't some of the portfolios just be worksheet pages or something a little simpler. I think some writing is good not so much. I also think there could be better science experiments. Our latest one 5th grade one was freezing water to see which freezes faster cold or hot. It took over 3 hours to get the water to freeze. My daughter had to check it every 10 minutes. Then repeat it 2 more times!! That's just crazy.

In fact, I feel like I can't get my child to take some of the opportunities available that they should. We love CCA. A little more peer pressure in the good ways, from teachers would be helpful. My teen always responds to the teachers well on the phone - it's a sort of accountability that's a little better than an email or her parents. (Though, I know more work for already busy teachers.) I appreciate that they try at all. Also, I think it would help my daughter if she was unable to get so far behind - because of stronger repercussions than are currently in place. Other teens were openly admitting they were 50 lessons behind at a CCA event to my daughter. I think the kids need to feel the pain of that. If your sick or funeral, ok, but sometimes, they are so relaxed at home - in good ways, I think they can get lazy and lose focus. I guess the consequence comes when they are rushing at the end of semesters, but I wonder if its a real pain to teachers at the end. We took my child out for a few months - she wasn't being educated well in the new school, so we put her back in CCA quickly, and she was very happy, but I noticed she instantly was less responsible with timing on assignments. I want her to feel the pain of that a little more than she does, like losing points if she turns it in late -not just a \"temporary zero\" and a grumpy mom. In real life - things have to be done on time. It seems talking to other people \"Portfolios\" seem to get people behind the most.

Mrs. Glotfelty is abrupt, nasty, and intimidates my child so much so that my child refuses to ask her any questions. She critiques classroom work with responses such as \"this is awkward\" along with similar responses that are just as vague and nonspecific. Without specificity, a child cannot improve on whatever issue is supposedly being addressed. My child was a prolific poet and book writer but now has soured on the experience of expressing via written form solely due to the interactions with Mrs. Glotfelty. Additionally, I personally have double-checked Mrs. Glotfelty's critiques of my child's work and have found multiple occurrences of inaccuracy. For example, Mrs. Glotfelty stating that a particular piece of content is missing when, in fact, that specific content was in the next few sentences. My child is so frightened by her that [my child] didn't even feel comfortable with me personally addressing the inaccuracy with Mrs. Glotfelty.

His school's platform (Moodle) is extremely difficult for the parent user to navigate.\n\n",null,"I have found CCA's curriculum to be at a higher level than our local public school, which is awesome. Their former public school teachers spent so much time disciplining and trying to keep control of the class, or in my older daughters case, expecting the students to figure out math concepts in groups of four kids who really weren't interested in learning, which wasted much of the school year. I appreciate the fact that teachers would help quickly (most of the time) when we had a problem or question.","Like I said in the last question, I am extremely satisfied with CCA and as long as this is where the Lord wants us, then we look forward to continuing with CCA through each new year.","Too much busy work in somethings, but overall a good experience.",null,"Overall I am very happy and unbelievably grateful that I have the opportunity to not put my child into the assigned public school, while also not having to pay an exorbitant amount for private school. I also believe that she is getting a better education with CCA then any other traditional option not only because of the curriculum but also because of the individual attention that she receives. I believe that in a traditional environment she would be passed over because she is not top of the class nor bottom, both of which I believe receive the most attention.","We have enjoyed being part of CCA.",null,"CCA rescued my child out of a bad learning environment. CCA allows him to grow and be more independent rather than trying to fit into a bad social mold which is found in his brick and mortar school district. CCA has been a lifesaver to our family.","CCA has been the best public school option for us. \nMy son attended a brick-and-mortar charter from K-4, and they worked very hard to accommodate his autism and attendant sensory issues, but he still could not meet his academic potential in a class room setting.\nThe online/home environment is optimal.",null,null,null,null,null,null,"We enjoy CCA, however, it is more difficult and time consuming for the whole household when the LL are split into morning and afternoon.

It is refreshing to be in a school where the child comes first, and I don't have to fight tooth and nail for what he needs like in the school district.","We truly have enjoyed the fieldtrips and additional events (STEM, etc) that CCA has offered as we were concerned we would not have many.

Maybe we might be at fault, but as of now we not sure how she can get help.","I was told when enrolling with CCA that my high school student would spend  approximately 6 hours a day on school.  This simply is not true.  \nMy student spends at least 6 hours a day on lessons and live lessons - this does not include study time or the dozens of portfolios.\nSadly we were mislead.  \nI do think some portfolios are beneficial - but one for every unit in every core subject just too much.

I think the classes are great, and I especially love how the everything ties together.  My hesitation with the school is in regards to communication with teachers in the future.  When all you have is the phone and e-mail, its pretty critical that you get it right.  If I can't communicate with the one person I need to talk to after several days of attempting I'm not very pleased.  In my mind if I have to do it alone why don't I just home school myself.  Never having a response to an email after several attempts at contact is not acceptable for a professional in any profession.","We very much enjoy the field trip opportunities as they allow the kids to explore different areas of interest.  We do feel as though we missed out on a few that looked very interesting due to the one paid trip per month rule.  We would love to see this rule adjusted for next school year.  Perhaps families could pay full price for additional trips?","I like having my daughter go to CCA. She likes the teacher she has as long as she does not give her to much school work tipical child.

This year my daughter's teachers have been very helpful and supportive with the issues that we have been dealing with her.",null,"Overall it has been a positive experience so far and I am glad we switched.","When my daughter started with CCA 3 years ago, she was an 8th grader and a mess- socially and academically.  Her experience with CCA has helped her to grow into a confident, mature 10th grader that is excellent at managing her time, asking for help when she needs it, and going the extra mile on papers/projects.  CCA has allowed her the space to work through her struggles and learn about her abilities.  I cannot thank the middle school and HS staff enough for these gifts given to my daughter.  \nMy son is currently finishing 4th grade (his second year with CCA).  Things went so well for our daughter in her first year, we decided to give it a try with our younger child.  When he enrolled, he was below grade level in both math and language arts.  He is currently at the top of his class and receives amazing feedback from his teacher on projects and assessments.  He tests at or above grade level on all iReady assessments and Dibels.  He, like his sister, has grown so much socially AND academically.  The shy kid that was terrified to give an incorrect answer is now the first one to raise his hand at field trips.  At home, he reads and reads and then reads some more.  In addition, I am amazed on a regular basis how much he has grown in math skills.  Lessons that used to take tearful hours (for both of us), he now completes with ease.  I credit this to the dedicated teachers and thorough curriculum provided by CCA.  I truly cannot thank the elementary teachers and field trip coordinators (Thelma and Brittany in particular) for all that they have done for my son.","im so glad we found cca it works wonderful 4 kim\n","I am passionate about improving and inspiring those around us with our experiences.

The style of letter written would always be typed today.  I felt there were significant inconsistencies this year.

I do believe, however, that more could be done to provide truth to the curriculum and to edify your students with values and morals.  For instance, the science curriculum should be much more careful about stating theories as theories and not as fact.  The history curriculum is very left-wing biased.  The English curriculum is full of poor content that works against teaching our children proper values.

Prior to CCA he was being promoted through the grade levels in a brick and mortar school without making any progress.

He is currently working on grade level as a distinguished honor roll student and will graduate with his class.  Thank you!  CCA has provided my honors student the opportunity to be creative in her schoolwork.  She finds her classes engaging, and enjoys the opportunity to challenge herself to exceed the expectations of portfolios and assignments. For both students, we thank CCA for the commitment of their teachers and staff.  Anyone who believes a cyber school is impersonal needs to try CCA.

The CCA teachers and staff on the other hand are wonderful!",null,"CCA listened to our thoughts on our son's education. His traditional school told us he would get what he needs but he never did. CCA gave him exactly what he needed from the start as they first listened to what we as parents had to say, then they looked at all of his documentation from school; report cards, testing, test scores and actual work he had done. Finally he was in classes that challenged him and have kept him interested with multiple ways of learning.

That was all the communication was between the student and the teacher. I feel that the teacher's where not there for the students. That they were only their for themselves. My daughter's teacher (Ms. Theil) was to involved in her boyfriend and the other teacher (Mrs Roth). I felt that it was very unprofessional. This was the only time that they can meet their teacher's and to have an experience like that very disappointed! I will think twice next time before I will go on a field trip.

My son encountered never ending bullying at our local public school which caused him extreme anxiety and affected his academic performance.  CCA has provided a safe learning environment, excellent curriculum, and stellar teacher support.  Thank you CCA!","CCA offered my daughter an alternative when she most needed one. Traditional school was not working for her. The classes and teachers in her first year here were what really swayed us. She made connections with several of the teachers and would have enjoyed more classes with them. They went out of their way to help. She is a hard sell so this was not an easy thing to do. She has some health issues. When she isn't up to regular school she can still keep a class schedule and do things in her own time.

The past two years that my daughter has been with CCA my child has grown, and is so happy and loves school again. Thank you to all of you","The other major issue I had (and shared with tech support who could not have cared less) was related to the CyberSitter (now K9) software. At the beginning of the year I contacted tech support to install the software. It worked great - no problems. During February, there was a problem with my daughter's computer. When tech support was contacted, they directed us to return the computer to them for maintenance. Approximately 1-2 weeks later we received a new laptop. There was no notification that the computer no longer had the security software installed. I did not discover this until nearly 2 weeks later when I noticed my daughter was falling behind on her lessons. Upon investigation, I noted that she was spending time on Facebook and Pokemon.com. I contacted tech support and had the new security software installed; however, I also noted that failure to notify me that the software was no longer on the computer was unacceptable. I tried to convey that a simple notification - perhaps on the shipping email that is sent, would be helpful; however, they did not see an issue with this. I realize that no software is 100% when limiting access to certain material, but had I been notified that the software was no longer loaded, I would have immediately called tech support to have it re-installed.","We have been very happy with CCA.  The program has made it possible for us to do volunteer work, provide work experience and job training for our students.  We could not do this in another program.  Our students are getting a solid foundation for the future along with practical life skills.","Thank you for the opportunity to experience education in this format!!!","We are not happy with all Common Cord curriculum.",null,null,"I think I was pretty thorough in my prev response. :)","I am so glad we found CCA.

My 1st grader was sent a computer without a webcam and they use them a lot! If you guys are a cyber school, shouldn't your tech be at least close to quality? Also, there are pilot programs in some local districts here to include some cyber schooling in their programs because it is cheaper for them to develop a program than to lose the tax money to you guys. They are distributing tablets and new generation laptops. If this continues, you guys are not going to have much of an advantage at all.","Most of our interaction with staff has been excellent.  In my opinion, parents need to be just as involved whether it is in a bricks-and-mortar school, or in a cyber school. It takes BOTH parental involvement and teacher/staff input to help a child succeed and achieve the desired results.  The teachers need the parents/coaches and the parents/coaches need the teachers to help resolve difficulties in the educational process.","It would be nice for my daughter to work ahead when she has the time but most if not all of the teachers frown on this.","This type of education is excellent for the right student. Being a good learning coach, however, requires a tremendous commitment of time and energy.  It literally changes one's life.  That causes me to wonder how well this model fits most families' lives, especially when so many families are two earner families.  I have no answers to this dilemma, but I do suggest that it is an issue that needs to be considered.  What infrastructure can be created to make up for the fact that, in most families, coaching on a regular basis is not realistic?","CCA has worked out very well for our family, however, I think it is not for most families.  I say this because I know what it takes to be a learning coach.  I changed my life to do this, and I am not gainfully employed.  I spend many hours working with my children, and I stay right on top of things.  Many learning coaches don't do this, and some may not have the emotional or intellectual wherewithal (or the time).  The program is only as good as its curriculum, instructors and learning coaches.  If one of these is weak, the whole system is weak.  You have control over two of these.  CCA, and cyber schools in general, have to think through how to provide more support on the family side.  For example, should there be places where kids can come and participate each day as a group, with hired coaches?","As of right now, I have no comments.","My children love this learning atmosphere.",null,null,null,"It is a great school with great teachers.

I can appreciate the need to carefully observe the budget, however I feel my children have lost too many oppurtunities to learn hands on and socialize.  I specifically chose CCA because of the many field trips.  The curriculm at CCA is great and I feel my children are learning at a rate exceeding B&amp;M but the down fall of cyber school is the chance to interact with other children in an educational and social enviroment.  But the decrease in avaliablity of field trips due to money has decreased those oppurtunities.  My children never complain about their CCA lesson and do not wish to return to B&amp;M but they have vocalized serveral times how much they miss being with friends.  I have also observed many amazing field trips being cancelled because not enough people signed up which I feel is without a doubt because of the new rule.  I know to many this \"complaint\" seems ridiculous because money is better spent on supplies and education, however my opinion is along with the great education CCA offers being face to face with other kids is equally important for an overall healthy educational experience.

Children and the parents we feel and appreciate at CCA are not just sitting around,  CCA has helped our child with time management skills, transitioning skills, self-initiative and so much of a sense of accomplishment.

Not only because of the issues with her anxiety, but we are disgusted by our public school system and the behavior most of the families consider 'acceptable behavior'. The brutal and unacceptable things that happen on a daily basis would have a severely negative impact on our daughter. After some research and suggestions from close friends we chose CCA. This was the best decision we made thus far in her life! It is a learning experience for our entire family. Her older siblings (1 adult brother and 1 brother in 12th at our public school) get involved and help out which makes her very happy. She gets to have a multitude of input in her daily routine and what she want to learn first. Our Family mentor, Sherri Stormer, and her daughter have been a god sent since day one! Sherri  has helped my daughter overcome so much in such a short time. We would be lost without her! Her classmates and their families are truly wonderful people and strive for the best from their children, and it shows. The curriculum is easy to follow, and if by chance we run into any problems the staff and especially her teachers are very eager to help solve any issue. After having 2 children go through brick and mortar, and all the issues and negative things that have happened, there aren't words to say how much of a blessing this school has been for our family.

My daughter has a attention span. Because she has a hard time staying still much let alone pay attention so this is a daily task for me.

Having a local PAC office in Erie was nice but given the economic conditions and low CCA enrollment here it is understandable why CCA could not have a satellite office but why not look into having a \"satellite room or desk\" perhaps donated by a local business, law firm, hospital or educational institution where a CCA rep could come once or twice a week and service students  and encourage new enrollments by having ( or being close to where they could set up)  lectures, lessons, get together's, robotic clubs,  STEM, do evaluations/testing etc.  Erie has local student theater/ playhouse, ballet, junior philharmonic, Box of Light (Robotics), Tom Ridge  Environmental Center, Brig Niagara/ Maritime museum -  things that are occasional field trips but have never been tapped on a regular basis for more in depth educational opportunities for students in the area.....Having  a CCA rep traveling I 79 each week would go from one end of the state --Erie  to the other - Pittsburgh","no comments\n",null,"CCA is truly an exceptional school.

If the curriculum is not improved though this would be a moot point, b/c the curriculum is a glaring problem particularly the Common Core Math.  The tests and measurements used also have proven to be unfair or purposefully confusing or require using methods that are poor such in Math class.  If a student excels at Math they should not be forced to try and subtract using number lines for example, as if this is a real method any good math student would ever use.  Wasting a students time and then penalizing them for it with tests that focus on these poor methods is beyond frustrating.  For us CCA represents a blend of what we hope is the best of homeschooling, with support from teachers and additional opportunities for my student as she gets older.  Wasting her time for hours each week trying to learn idiotic Math \"methods\" such as using blocks to add 100's together leaves us with a negative feeling.  If someone asked me if they should consider CCA I would at this point be hesistant, due to the curriclum and testing being all over the place and the Math curriculum being something that will without a doubt produce confused and worse math students in the future.",null,null,"...","One of the best schools my children attended.

Field trips were one of the things that brought us to your school and our 7th grader was very upset with the lack of them.","I would love to see CCA have a PTA something for the parents to get involved in. I love all the Field trips but it would also be nice to have more localize group gatherings.  I also miss Hershey and you will hear me whine about that all the time :-) CCA though in my opinion is the best school out there. My older son start in kindergarten not even knowing his letters and by first grade was reading at a 3rd grade level. My younger son completed kindergarten math and first grade math both in kindergarten, So he is in first grade but doing second grade math. I love the flexibility there for him and the extra help my older son had to improve so much in just a year. CCA has done so much for our family I couldn't be more happy with them. I cant see any other school filling there shoes.","CCA has been wonderful.","I don't know if this will count here, but my son is highly interested in the coding and computers club. In may we are going down to the Harrisburg campus to meet the coding club instructor and they are having an in person teaching session. He is very excited. I am hoping for the future more coding opportunities will be available possibly in the Dickson  city office because that is so much closer.","I believe your online teaching application is difficult.

My Son is self motivated and this style of learning is effective for him.","I am so pleased with CCA.  My child has special needs and the teaching staff is amazing with him.  I just wish the staff that is in charge of his 504 plan would reach out to me throughout the school year to ask how my child is doing.  I do believe there was a turnover in staff in this area, but I had to be the one to reach out to the person in charge instead of her reaching out to me and introducing herself.","I would like all live lessons taped to see again for review and to see at a later time if you missed one. I would like to view them too because my grandson does not relay information about upcoming tests, so we can study and review.",null,null,"I truly love CCA for my children.

I struggle with being kept in the dark about major changes.  I was asked to complete an intent to return not knowing what the computer system will look like or the workload.  I chose CCA after I reviewed the materials and structure, it was the deciding factor for us.  However, the lack of communication from administration and the focus on marketing with various outlets makes CCA feel more like a business now than a school that we wanted to be a part of.",null,"CCA is above and beyond school district education.

He actually looks forward to doing his math software and reading software. \nI love that there is no required time frame to be logged into CCA for a school day, if my son is having a rough day we can take a time out and he can wrap up in his blanket and rock or count and complete his school work when he is ready within a reasonable amount of time. I limit him to an hour max of blanket break time.\nI also love how if the kids go to live lessons that the teachers offer or watch the recording if the time is bad for them, the teacher will teach the lesson and I don't have to! \nParents don't have to create the curriculum the teachers do that for us and customize it for our children's learning abilities.","Glad to have the cyber school option.

I like that the school staff is very understanding if life problems and move to help out when needed.",null,"As I mentioned earlier, we are more than pleased with CCA.  Our student is growing up, thriving, learning, and loving it, without the added pressures of public school on him.  We do make sure he knows \"he is in school\" by having set times for class each day, and by expecting the correct behavior that he would exhibit as if he was in a classroom with a teacher in front of him all the time.  A certain amount of discipline is a must, but parents and grandparents are now, and always have been, the best source for learning so many things.  In this environment \"peers\" do not have near as much influence, especially during a child's informative years.","I feel the assignments aren't very difficult, but the many Portfolio's all at one time are.

I also am very saddened by the continuing loss of flexibility into the maw of such policies as AIO, temp 0s, etc. Because of that alone, I am glad we are almost done with school. I have seriously considered leaving for real home schooling opportunities. All that aside, and it is a lot, we have stayed because we could see the light at the end of the schooling tunnel. We stayed because things haven't crossed certain lines I have drawn in the sand that would have sent us completely out of the cyber school orbit and into new and freer realms. We stayed because we have always felt a certain amount of loyalty to CCA, despite my complaints. None of us ever wanted a school tee before, and now all of us have them. There's a sticker and a magnet on the car. The home environment, its opportunities, and the way it colors the cyber school world were what made this possible. CCA made it possible to tap into that home environment in ways we never dreamed of when we started out on this exciting and scary effort. We made it work. We expanded in creative, exciting ways. All of us have been able to develop in richer, cleaner, healthier ways than would have been possible in B&amp;M school. The over all effect of CCA has been quite good for us. We comment on this among ourselves regularly. When CCA is less like a public school, it is better at being itself, better at meeting the needs of students and families.",null,"Overall CCA has been great for our family.

The amount of work assigned on the planner AFTER the AP test is also baffling. After the AP test, the lessons should end, just like in a bricks and mortar school. There are too many assessments overall and too much content in CCA courses. The pace is beyond merely challenging; it's punishing. We have very much appreciated the teachers over the  years, though.

However, it seems like it's trying to get too big or something and is losing its appeal.  I actually sent the high school principal an email after they decided to change the live lesson format, letting him know that my children hated it and their teachers did too.  He responded (not to me personally), but with an email to all parents and learning coaches and I think students as well, saying that the new live lesson format was a huge success and that everyone loved it.  My two high-schoolers (who used to attend the majority of their live lessons) stopped going because they said it was too many kids in each one all typing in the chat pod and they much preferred the old format with just their teacher and their classmates.  This change was obviously the principal's idea, because he wouldn't even listen to my opinion and totally disregarded it, basically saying that I was wrong and he was right.   I really hope that CCA truly uses this survey to try to improve.","I think this is a great way to educate my children.

Allowing the student to have the whole semester to submit it.\n\nAlso, I do not think classes should be scheduled on the days Keystone/State testing is scheduled. This should be a time for the students to review what they have learned so they can score better on the Keystone Exams.  It is very stressful for my child when she has to complete daily lessons and travel up to a half hour to the testing facility, to take a test that is very stressful to take in the first place. This is all too much in the same week, with other lessons being piled on. My child also works two part time jobs on top of this as she wants to pay for her own college. The additional practice the week of keystone testing would only benefit the students,  as it will still be fresh in their minds.","We miss the Hershey trips because we were able to meet all of our teachers that we don't ever see and it was something we looked forward to during the middle of the school year (hard work).","We are still very new with cca but overall we are very pleased so far.",null,null,null,null,null,"My students have all gained from their experience with CCA.

When we were homeschooling traditionally, so much of our time was spent outdoors or on trips. I realize that CCA offers many wonderful field trips, but I find that we have little time to participate. \n\nThere is also a lack of solemnity surrounding the Honor Roll. I don't expect a parade, but my elementary student consistently receives certificates that are printed or cut crooked. My high school student received a blank .pdf in her email. She was literally not even recognized on the certificate. These are kids who have worked very hard. \"Honor Roll\" denotes a level of achievement that is extraordinary. The certificates should be offered with this in mind, otherwise the achievement is undermined and the reward falls flat. If resources are scarce, it would be better to not offer honor roll status than to treat it as a throwaway.\n\nOverall, our experience has been a good one, and we will be returning.","There are some wonderful faculty that are responsive and helpful and others that take forever to grade items and are not nearly as helpful.

I am connected on Facebook to an unofficial CCA group that is pretty helpful, but it is so large that I only really know like 2 parents in the group. It connects ALL parents in CCA, so you can imagine how big that is.  It would be really great to talk to other parents about the material our kiddos are working on, or be able to have the kids interact with each other from time to time outside of the live lesson room. We aren't always able to go to field trips, and many of the kids in our homerooms don't live locally, so we never end up knowing them. I don't know if it's possible for CCA to set up some kind of social meeting thing on the school site or what that would look like... But there is a need for connection among parents and kids too.

I am also disappointed that CCA still does not have a way to track webmails or monitor the appropriateness of student webmail content.  A student can easily send an inappropriate email containing language or pictures with nudity, delete the message from their sent folder, and there would be no record that it was ever sent.

Trying to obtain proper modifications for a student's course work is like pulling teeth with your teachers because they lack experience! Your staff are not properly trained to handle learning disabilities! My overall experience is very disappointing! The classes are so small with only 30 minutes with no one on one time with the teachers. Having one on one time with the teachers should be apart of your program for special needs students! This school is only willing to do the bare minimum! \n\nRe-structure the Special Education Program that is in place! Hire teachers and learning support staff with REAL experience with learning disabilities! Stop wasting the federal funding! Remove the courses that are irrelevant from the curriculum for the students who need more reading and math assistance! Stop relying on inaccurate software data to do the work that a learning support teacher is supposed to be highly trained and skilled to do! Hire teachers who are willing to work one on one with students to personally monitor and keep accurate track of the students academic progress. Hire teachers who are willing to go above and beyond for their students!",null,"Love the teachers","n/a","This is the best school EVER!!!!!!","I think that new families have a hard time seeing how to access the information about the field trips.

Brick and Mortar students are not asked to make up 15-20 hours of class time due to state testing, even if you don't watch the recordings for those days you have hours of \"work\" to do.

My 11th grader is excelling and doing very well.  However, my 10th grader has really struggled, but that is not necessarily CCA's fault.  He is reluctant to call his teachers often, even though I remind him at least weekly that he should touch base.
