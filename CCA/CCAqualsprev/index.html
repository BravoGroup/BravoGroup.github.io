His previous teachers spent too much time on his flaws than his strengths.

We also like the live lessons ~ it has been helpful to still be able to touch base with classmates and teachers in a live situation. We actually feel that communication has been better between our 8th grader and her teachers. This has been the best school experience so far for our 8th grader.....she is not extremely social and would get frustrated in the traditional school environment because her classmates would be distracting or cause the teacher to not be able to teach the lesson. I appreciate our family mentor calling to check in and being very helpful. Everyone we have been in contact with has been very helpful.","I appreciated the schedule this year.  How the teachers worked together and how the live lessons were scheduled.

I love all our teachers. I like the field trips.

I love the accountability CCA gives me, as a Learning Coach.","My daughter likes interacting with her peers in a format where they are all compelled to think twice about what they say, because it's being sent with no nonverbal cues.  She also likes that peers form opinions and ideas about one another based on their ideas and work ethic, as opposed to fashion, make-up, other friends, etc.  I like that the majority of her classes are filled with kids who take learning seriously. She is gifted classes.  We have also been blown away by the incredible field trip opportunities she has had for his year - several of which some, or all, of my other three children were able to experi, as well. Mr. Amen's STEM events were incredible!  I don't think she might shed more than one.  She would not shave gotten these opportunities elsewhere.

The ability to spend more time on lessons where our student is struggling has helped him catch up academically, filling in \"blanks\" left by weak programs at his old brick-and-mortar school. Because he's a \"504 kid,\" we can use the recorded lessons, note outlines provided by instructors, and (as needed) a hands-on approach to provide the accommodations his old school was always reluctant to offer.

If she were in a brick and mortar school, she would fall under the radar because she is \"not as bad as other kids\", a.k.a. not autistic.

She deserves to be given the tools to succeed.","We can build our own schedule.","Flexibility","The flexibility in getting assignment done","I like that my child gets to work at her own pace.

There are several items that I could talk about til the cows come home.  One thing I really appreciate is the use of the webcams for the elementary students this year.  When my son was in the elementary school, there was no use of the webcams even though the school had the technology.  So this has been absolutely great and I am appreciative.  The teachers, well, there is not enough space to tell my positive feelings about the teachers this year.  I would like to specifically mention Mrs. Keet, my daughter's first grade teacher.  She is absolutely fabulous.  She is welcoming of all the students, she is warm and makes all the children feel cared for.  She has a wonderful way of being consistent and innovative with lessons and specials offered in live lesson.  She engages all her students incredibly well and manages the classroom with expertise and love.  I do like ow the field trips compliment the in class learning but I am especially pleased with the STEM program.  I am glad that CCA has found a way to offer STEM activities to the elementary school as there are other schools who only offer STEM to high school, middle school only if in a good district.  So I am impressed with this program.  Keep it coming.  Again, the staff are excellent and easy to talk to even when the topic is not so easy.  They are very respectful and I always feel heard.","The support for my child, flexibility, the commitment that the teachers seems to have and the overall course work. My daughter had an IEP upon entering high school. I admitted her to another cyber charter in which I was very dissatisfied with although the IEP was dropped.

The teachers and staff really care about my child and me - not only grades, but about our family, about my child, her interests, her well-being. CCA as a whole has a nurturing environment, the school itself seems devoted to the student's well-being and learning. The teachers work together as a team, there is great communication, CCA really does consider the parent/caretaker as part of the team (not the enemy). Any questions or concerns I have are addressed immediately. There is open communication, frequent meetings, and I don't have to fight for answers. It is a lot of work, yes - but I am deeply involved in my child's education, and this is the way it should be.","Son does not have to leave home. Can see and hear whats going on with grades.

Dr. Flurie is always updating families and he really cares about us, you can tell. The teachers are also very good at what they do. This year we noticed that the teachers are even better with their own availability to students, happy last year, but even better this year. CCA seems very serious about being a stellar competitive school and it shows. I only wish I would have made the decision to have my child attend CCA long ago, but she will graduate (proudly) from CCA this year and we're happy with that. Thank you to Dr. Flurie, Amy Boyd, the teachers, Counserlors, Mr. Comegna was wonderful and very helpful. We will show you how much we appreciate CCA by giving well deserved great reviews and informing parents about CCA and all they stand for. THANKS MUCH.","My child can work at her own pace.

Field trips, and family mentor support.","teacher, activities, etc \r\n","I fell that CCA had a lot more to offer than the other online schools that my children went to.","I like that I am able to be apart of my childs learning experience.","My child feels safe learning at home. She loves the fact that if she have questions the teachers are always there to help. I feel that she is overwhelmed with the portfolios. They should be at the end of each semester. Doing live lessons, lesson planner assignments, and portfolios is a bit much for a child to take in and complete within a week. I feel that it's not allowing her time to actually study for something she doesn't understand due to meeting deadlines. Otherwise, the school is awesome and I'm proud to be a CCA parent.","The Curriculum, the pace and staff","my daughter can pace her self nd I hear from the teachers regulary","We can work from home.","Being involved with my child education and helping her through every step of her growth.

It's like refresher courses when I went to school.The family mentor calls and she makes you feel comfortable enough to talk freely as does the teachers. CCA gives their students time to change their grades and if any student thinks they can get away with school work .....they are sadly mistaken and I LOVE THAT!!!\r\n","I love CCA's resources they have for children when they're struggling with different classes. I like when you web mail a teacher and get a response in a timely manner.","My son was bullied for two years,since we moved here,the school didnt care and would not do anything ,I let it go and watch % other kids chasing him to beat him up,only becaues he was white only one in the school at that time,but majority rules,there is racism but to every ethnic,I can feel safe knowing ,he is safe ,thats why he is embrassed because he is behind ,but in his mind  so worried about everyone else,not thinking of him self\r\n\r\n\r\n","I like that its convenience","I like that the teachers call and check up on the students.","I appreciate the flexibility the school offers as well as all of the support the staff provides.","I love the flexibility.

I love the fact that there is no more bullying, no violence and no worries. My children are in a safe environment. The teachers are amazing. They have time to par take in other activities. I am always referring and recommending CCA to other parents because of the amazing service and education my children has received over the years. This year my oldest son is graduating from CCA and I am very proud to say he as been accepted to his number one university of choice Temple University and he will be majoring in Music Education.

CCA is perfect for our children who are at-risk in a crime ridden city with many issues!  CCA also in my opinion out ranks all of the brick and Morter schools available in the Philadelphia area.  The majority of the school system in Philadelphia is in disarray across the board and turning out academically handicapped students year after year unfortunately. CCA continues to exceed expectations. \r\n","That he can work at his own pace and the modified quizzes and tests","online and flexibility","I like the communication between teachers and students .

Hands on in my Childs education.","The flexibility of the scheduling and taking of classes","The teachers are great .","Specifically about CCA - Professional, Knowlegeable and Caring Leadership and Teachers.

I am a bit disappointed with the amount of time and energy that is required to do well in the course.  There are an excessive amount of portfolios for the students.  My daughter in 9th grade has to spend most of her time doing school work.  It is just too much work.  There should be opportunities for the students to interact with one another at the local office for spelling bees or games or movies.  They should be able to meet other live students and not just online.","The fact that the work is online and we can contact the teachers via webmail or on the phone.","Convenience and the amount and the quality of the materials.

I have my own child and work with my niece and nephew. there is a five year difference between them. Having their lessons do what I call \"synch up\" is extremely helpful. It also lets the younger one feel like a big kid because I can often allow her to work with the older ones in a way that remains familiar to her. It also allows the older ones to flex their knowledge muscles by \"teaching\" her things she hasn't gotten to yet. There are many other things I have come to love about CCA and they are why we are in our 11th year with them. As my daughter's final year approaches, I am remorseful because not only have I been able to expand her knowledge, my knowledge has increased as well.","The flexibility for the students and the exceptional customer service provided by the staff.","CCA have good communication skills, they keep  a relationship with families ,it's a great program!","I love how my daughter has a flexible schedule and she is in a safe environment just in case something goes down.","My child can move at her own pace without distractions.I also like the amount of time spent in her sessions.","Reading Eggs and Brain Pop","The teachers and being able to work with the children","The staff members are courteous and polite.","The teacher  is very helpful","My child has enjoy learning more overall and that's all I ever really wanted","The teachers and family mentor","Being able to move at a certain pace.","The staff is professional and caring.","The flexibility. Because of my daughter's personal and medical issues we need a program that allows for the interference of her appointments, but also allows her to maintain a her grade point average by being able to complete assignments and recive the grade a child without so many issues is capable of. She is able to complete assignments without being stressed about her performance or a time limit which causes the greatest amount of stress and thereby affected her ability to concentrate and perform at her best.","The fact that my child can get be schooled at home without distraction from others kids.","What I like best is how good he's doing.","I like how MOST of the teachers are attentive and caring.","THE CONVIENENCE OF NOY HAVING TO LEAVE HOME , AND NOT HAVING TO MISS SCHOOL DUE TO BAD WEATHER.","CCA is the best.

I also like the interaction the students get with their teachers.","I like that it makes me (the student) feel comfortable in my own environment.","My son has ADHD and other health problems so this was the best decision I made for him.  He can work anytime and in your school he can get more of a one on one with his teachers than in a classroom of 30 or more children.","Pretty much everything the staffs are very kind and helpful and so are the teachers.","l appreciate how the homeroom teacher reaches out, giving him motivation to catch up in different subjects. He really does care about my sons progress.","Easy to access on phone or computer. My child loves live lessons. You can contact teacher for any additional help. Flexible student learning time.

They are learning things that the public schools are not teaching in this grade and it makes me feel confident with this school to know that my children are receiving the best education.","I like the quality of the educational programs and the fact that my student can work at his pace.  The teachers are very helpful.  I feel that CCA is giving a private school education at a public school cost - free.","What I like the most about CCA is that they give the kids lots of work to do. Also that they have school books to learn from. CCA school curriculum is awesome.","I used to like the scheduling of the Live Lessons, but not anymore.  They conflict.","The major benefit of CCA over our public school options is that assignments are not missed. Each assignment is graded, feedback and guidance are given, and the family has input in how to make the student's education more/less challenging.

CCA allows John to learn at his own pace in the comfort of his own home. The special education team is fantastic about setting up John's IEP and getting him the help he needs. The teachers have been so wonderful and supportive. I have to give special mention to his 8th grade teachers. John has missed time this year while admitted in Janet Weis Children's Hospital  and various other medical appointments.

Also, my son plays competitive ice hockey all year round, so this gives us the ability to travel often. We can take our lap top with us and complete classes or lessons while on the road. I feel like CCA allows us to spend quality time together and as a bonus, helps my child develop valuable life lessons.  He learns to organize his time by completing his lessons before he plays his games or does his training.","I feel the quality of student/family support and teacher instruction is very strong.","Ease of use, kindness of staff, readiness to help when needed, best school my child has attended","The course selections","The flexibility with being able to attend a live lesson as it is happening or having the option to view it at a later time.

At this point, he is 91% through the semester and 92% through the year on his course progression meter.  He has finished quite a few courses for the year, including, but not limited to his Chinese class, his Biology, class, his Health class, and nearly finished with his Geography class.  He is on the route to graduating a year prematurely.  He is taking summer classes to accommodate that goal as well.

I feel this is so beneficial for my daughter because it allows her to work on school and learn when her mind and her focus are at highest level.  As we all know, each day is different for kids.  Sometimes they are ready to hit the computer running first thing in the morning, but other days have a slow start.  CCA gives you that ability to let your child make the choice to want to learn.  I also love that CCA has a whole life approach to learning.  That learning isn't just what is in a book.

The two oldest graduated and the remaining 3 and I decided to evaluate our direction.  Here we are, almost 6 years later, continuing education with CCA. I love the support of the teachers, the organization of the curriculum, the obvious desire of the school to see their students succeed.  We all love the fact that we are not forced to attend a live lesson as it happens.  The option to view a recorded lesson is great and fits into our schedule.  My preference is that they would attend the live lessons as they are scheduled, but the recorded option is one of the reasons we chose CCA more than 5 years ago and have continued to choose CCA as our school.","We LOVE that it is flexible!  Also, my child does best with one on one learning and we are able to do that with CCA.  There are no kids being distracting and there are no bullies.  There are also no snow days to worry about making up.","We like that it is flexible and the student can learn at his/her own pace.","i like the ease and ability to do work at anytime of the day.","Flexible schedule.","I especially appreciate the flexibility CCA has to offer.

The teachers really seem to care and engage with the students, and take the time to create interesting assignments.  The curriculum is flexible and gives our son the capability to (mostly) work from his schedule, which means he can take music lessons or tennis lessons during the day.  Finally, the structure of the school has made him much more self-sufficient and self motivated, which is a hugely important skill for high school and college.","The fact that my son can learn at his own speed while still being challenged. I also love that each class is recorded so I can help him when needed","My student is able to communicate with the teacher and his classmates yet still he is able to maintain a flexible schedule is what I love about this school.

The ability to adapt the learning pace to the individual student.","What my son and I like best is that he is not rushed through the learning process. When he attended a traditional school he was left behind and did not receive the help he asked for. The teachers had to move on and there was a lack of help. My son was doing well at a traditional school however, he was getting to stressed and frustrated at such a young age and that was not something a child should go through. Since we started CCA my son has learned so much more and we are able to take our time where he understands the assignments better and go back through the videos.","I like that my child is able to go at her own pace and not be rushed to finish her work.","Flexibility.","There is a reasonable amount of school work with only a minimum of busy work.","no homework","My son being able to learn subjects at his own pace","the flexibility","teachers are flexible and enthusiastic","Perks of field trips and reimbursed community classes\r\n","The flexibility with her schedule and working more at her own pace.

The teachers do not punish a student for handing in homework late (ie. deducting points or only giving half credit) but grade it appropriately.","The individual attention my child gets from a cyber school vs. a public school. The teachers at CCA also care more about the individual student(s) learning  the material and less about how long it takes them to learn and understand the material.","I like that the teachers actually call the parents regarding students attendance, grades, etc. and take note of a student is falling behind.","the flexibility of the schedule","The freedom, help and flexibility the teachers give my student to complete his homework, at his speed to be able to be able to understand the work, and hand it in for an appropriate grade.","I love having immediate access to all his work and grades.

For my 7th grader he is having to make real effort for the first time in his schooling.\r\nHe is also learning how to have relationships with his teachers. I have also developed a closer bond with my K daughter. \r\nBecause we are Jehovah's Witnesses, we do not celebrate the various holidays - Christmas, New Years, Thanksgiving, Halloween, Valentine's Day, St Patrick's Day, Easter, Mother's Day, Father's Day, etc.  In the Brick &amp; Mortar schools (UDA) we get these holidays essentially \"shoved down our throat.\"  In CCA we get to focus on learning the basics in K.\r\nAlso - very important, with CCA my son and daughter does not have a 45 min ride each way and they do not have to get up so early - (5:30 AM for Middle &amp; HS, 6:30 - 6:45 AM K-4).\r\nReturn Times are: MS &amp; HS -3pm, K-4 4 pm.

The ability to work at our family's pace and within our schedule is amazing. The course work is great, also. It's interesting and easy to follow, for both the students and the learning coach. The teachers are all willing to modify work to suit the student when something is too difficult or isn't keeping their interest. I love that the kids learn the histories of ALL religions and ALL people. Most schools are afraid to do that, even though it's very important. Their field trips are always awesome, too. There aren't enough good things I can say about CCA. I'm very grateful for the level of education and care that my children have gotten from CCA.","good open minded up to date modern classes and flexibility","Kids can complete assignments at their own pace.  Can go back and watch live lessons if they are not quite grasping a  lesson.

We are very thankful to have the option to take classes online from the comfort and safety of our own home.  It decreases the stress for a socially anxious teen to allow her to focus on her school work and not be distracted by other students or subjected to bullying.","At ease approach to learning, ability for my child to learn at his own pace, ability to review the live lesson on a recording for both him and myself.

He enjoys learning again!","Gracious and helpful teachers\r\n","Quality education in home environment","I am now an active participant in my son's education, that goes far beyond being a room parent.","The high school courses are set up so that it is easy for students to stay organized and to understand what is expected.  All the information a student needs is available and accessible.  The planner lets students see what assignments are due and what is coming up.  The course tree lets students know what is coming so they can plan for study time, research or writing.  All the assignments are clear, the rubrics lay out expectations.  The program selects the best text books, and online resources.  This program makes it possible for every student to succeed.  The live lesson recordings allow students to review as needed.  I could not be more impressed with the way coursework is organized.","We live can and the flexibility we have, the staff is also amazing.","The teachers are wonderful and so is the support that they give","convenient and flexible ,option for kids to be in safe environment.","The supportive/positive environment, the flexibility, the ability to be a part of my son's educational experience, and the field trips.

And my son especially enjoys the STEM field trips (as well as others, but definitely enjoys the STEM)","Flexible schedule, not having to deal with b&amp;m large classes, quality of most teachers in CCA is excellent.

Plenty of information available.","Flexibility of class time.","flexibility","I think CCA's committment to doing the best for their students and families is the thing I like best.  My experience with brick and mortar school was that they wanted to cut parents out of the equation, but with CCA, the parents are not only kept in the loop but are valued.  The flexibility of the program is also very important.  My son was becoming bored in brick and mortar school and was not given the opportunities to progress at his own pace.  CCA has provided that opportunity for him and it has changed him from being bored in school to being excited to learn again.  I also like the many field trip opportunities that CCA provides.  Learning happens in all sorts of places and the field trips add an extra component to their learning that doesn't happen in traditional schools.","Ease to use, flexibility of schedule","The ability to have first-hand knowledge what and how my children are learning as well as a tiny bit of flexibility with the schedule.","There are so many things I like about CCA.  I like that the teachers are available, caring, and want to see the kids succeed.  I like that my kids are able to ask questions and the teachers take the time to answer them.  I love the Live Lessons and how the teachers make the lessons interesting and easy to understand.  The teachers are willing to change if the students aren't getting the material.  Your staff and the Live Lessons are the greatest strengths CCA has.  We have been \"wowed\" by many of the teachers.  Many of them go above and beyond in their quest to teach our kids.","The best part is I can work one on one with my children.","The flexibility of the schedule and having my children home with me.","I like the flexibility and the ability to watch my child learn and grow.  The teachers and staff at CCA have been great and supportive and are responsive to us,  We love going on field trips.","How flexible it is, we can decide what schedule works best for him.","I like that CCA goes with my childrens pace and that they are able to ask their teacher at any time if they have a question.","I love how connected the teachers are with the students.  We came from a private brick and mortar school where the teachers did not have the time to connect individually with the student and know their strengths and weaknesses.  What a difference with CCA!  My son has so many options to get help and ask questions.  The proof of how much he enjoys his teachers is that every spring he is sad to know that he won't have those teachers any longer, but the following year he has a whole new group of wonderful teachers who are just as committed to seeing him succeed.  The wonderful thing about CCA for my daughter is that she can work at her own pace.  When she was in a private brick and mortar school, she felt frustrated waiting for the other kids to \"get\" a concept that she understood.  She grew bored and frustrated, now when she understands something she can move on to the next subject.  Thank you for giving my children back their love of learning.  When they were in school all day, they were too burned out to want to continue to pursue learning outside the classroom.  Now, my daughter writes stories in her free time, she works on budgets for herself, and loves to read.  My son has developed a strong love of history and knowledge and pursues both through watching educational videos, documentaries, and reading classic literature in his free time.  He now draws and sketches, where his previous art teacher offered no encouragement, CCA saw his potential.  I love that CCA knows when to give freedom to stretch and when to encourage reaching out for help!  You are the best!","the freedom to do courses from home","Everybody we've dealt with has been very helpful and friendly. My daughter seems much more relaxed in this environment.","Flexibility. Less stress for the same classes as public school","I like the freedom with the schedule and classes. I like that I have a huge input on my sons education and the way he is taught. I really enjoy getting to spend more time with him during the day.","I like that CCA has some great teachers. I appreciate being a part of my students' learning and understanding their learning style.  I also appreciate my students being able to learn in a safe environment.","Low stress environment, flexible due dates.","the teachers kindness an explaining showing helping my child with her work an mrs. sharp 4 th grade going the extra mile. and how the whole school reaches out to you for whats the best interest in ur child . i am so very pleased an its refreshing to have them listen to the parents concerns an i welcome their feed back . its nice to know they put ur child first","Just enrolled last week.  So far, I'm amazed how easy the learning has been made and the depth of what is available for the student.  Also feels much more personal than our brick and mortar school experience.","Flexibility of the program and the ability to tailor it to my student.","We like the flexilibilty, the ability to visit face to face with teachers in the Harrisburg office, and we love the field trips.  The field trips are very beneficial for soialzation and also for education.  It is wonderful for our child to attend trips that relate to what he is studying and it helps him apply what he is studying.","I like the flexibility CCA allows in our schedule.","I love that if she has a doctor's appointment, the classes are recorded so she is not missing a lesson.  She doesn't like to miss lessons, but it's a great tool!  She has also loved all the teachers she has had and currently has.  You have wonderful educators!","i am not sure yet my daughters on been enrolled a month","that my daughter can feel combfortable in her schooling....and the teachers are now helping her alot","The flexibility to complete my child's school whenever and wherever we are during the course of the day..","That it fits around my work schedule","Flexibility","We love the flexibility.

My children understand better with less goofing off in the class room. They can have their music and still understand what is happening in their lessons.","At this point im very dissatisfied with CCA","Were a team from the school to the learning coaches, apart of the learning experience, watching him grow an learn not missing out on it. Don't have to worry about what's being taught to my child, without me knowing, Don't have to worry about bullying, unlicensed teachers acting out  inappropriately to my child, Don't have to worry about bad lunches, sickness(as much), any other bodily problems that come with a school full of kids, And most of all I Love how its based all around him an his education there is no competition no judgment's, embarrassments, he's free to be him, and at his own rate, its very individualized to each child, everything about the CCA School is beautiful an feel proud an privileged to be apart of it, as well as grateful for my child I now he will get a good education threw this process of schooling. Each person who I've had the honor of meeting teachers an staff with CCA have been nothing but helpful, patient, an encouraging, We are a true team on working threw every detail together, no ones left in the dark, they keep everything up to date as well as information wise, your more than just another kid or a parent, Both parent an child have a huge roll playing a big part of the whole process","The flexibility and options","I like that its on line and we can choose the time we complete the lessons. very convient for a traveling mom","The teachers are very helpful and don't mind if I ask 20 silly questions. They all seem to understand kids better than traditional teachers. In example, the teenagers go through phases of barely skating by. The teachers let them make it up. The kids see it as more to their workload and a kind of punishment. I get to teach them to things right the first time.","Cirriculum, School Support to Stay on point to keep LC and Students moving forward so as no student can easily get lost in the cracks to say.\r\n","Providing the computer already set up and the textbooks.\r\nThe teachers take time to talk to parents on the phone.","That we can work at our own pace and I'm sure my students are understanding the material being covered.","The teachers actually help the kids...","The scheduling flexibility for instance my son needs to go to the podiatrist on the 22st so he wont be able to log in in the morning but when we get back he can log in to get his hours. I also like the wide course selection it allows the student to be engaged more in what they are learning .","When my son Jayden was attending PA Cyber, there were \"NO MODIFICATIONS MADE\" for him, for any of his classes.  CCA has been wonderful, with making sure Jayden \"HAS MODIFICATIONS MADE\" for him, in all of his classes.  Jayden has always had an IEP, but now with the extra help, and with caring and helpful teachers, Jayden can strive to meet his full learning potential.  I love CCA!","I am overwhelmed by the staffs willingness to understand Mackenzie's ongoing medical condition and it's effect on her ability to learn and participate; (especially as we are having a hard time understanding ourselves). Their willingness to try different tacks and approaches to help her to acquire the education she says she wants. And their patience on waiting for her body and mind to catch up with her desires. But what I like the most about this school and its personnel is its willingness to do whatever it takes to help her evaluate and define her dreams and goals and the work they are trying to put in to teaching her to find and develop the skills she will need to attain them.","The simplicity of scheduling school around life and emergencies.","I love CCA because it is very comforting for my child to feel successful and have the best education with all of the caring professional teachers he has come across over the last 3 years.","Terrific support from everyone associated with CCA.","I like being able to be with my son.  Being able to see what he is working on in school.  I like the certain freedom that cyber schools provide.  It is much easier to sleep until the first class vs. getting up much earlier to get your child off on the bus.  It is also easier to fit in a doctor appointment from time to time.  I like knowing that my child is ok, and not in a school someplace where there is nasty things going on.  My child is alive.  I kinda like that about him.","flexibility","flexibility, helpfulness of all departments","My children can be at home for their schooling, but still have the support of educated teachers.","flexibility","I like the convenience of being able to work at any time of day and taking school with us if we travel.","the interaction the student can have with the teacher, the quick response in questions we my have.","The flexibility.

He was in a constant state of fight or flight mode. He would explode, then shut down. There were inappropriate verbal issues as well as running from an aide. It culminated when I was called in to pick him up...he was lying on the floor of the principal's office, sobbing. All the accommodations and supports put into place just weren't working. In hindsight, I realize now, those supports were in place to make my son fit into their box, with little room for him to feel in control. My son is smart; he was speaking in full sentences before he was 2. Finding CCA gave me back my son. It gives my son enough of the control he needs to be able to advocate for himself. If an assignment is too overwhelming in that moment, he can walk away and come back to it without repercussions. He doesn't feel trapped anymore. There are no behavior issues in our home (except for the occasional teenage angst). I like the flexibility. I love how the teachers are genuinely there to help and seem like they want to hear from my son! My son is learning to think outside the box-the teachers will listen to his sometimes very different viewpoint and instead of being chastised, he is encouraged to find information to back up his story or gently redirected.

I like that our day doesn't have to be clogged up with things that are not essential.  I also love that my kids can be home but we still get the organization and help of being in a brick and mortar school.

I will be forever grateful to this school","The quick responses from teachers, the support and availability from our family coach.","I like the flexibility that CCA provides for my child. She is able to have a job as well as come home and complete her homework stress free.","Everything. CCA is awesome especially for children who do not cope well in public schools.

I really liked that when my students original teacher this year saw that my child was not up to the same level as the other students, she spoke to her supervisor and got my child switched to a program that was more at her level and where she could be successful this year. I also really love that I can get ahold of my child's teacher at pretty much any time through webmail and I always get a very fast response. CCA seems to be more focused on ensuring student success instead of just getting the students through another school year. My student is not rushed to have everything completed and can work at her own pace for the most part and her teacher is always willing to keep her after in her live lesson room to give my child one on one time when she sees her struggling with something new. This was the first year of schooling my daughter has had, and I have to say I wish this option had been available to me when I was still in school.

To our surprise, first Mrs. Mary Frances Thorn understand and gave him the time but then later penalized him for taking the time. His final test grade was an A but she did not accept work he submitted after \"HER timeline\" and only her timeline which resulted in a C and not a B.  He then changed teacher and earned his A in Algebra 11. His other issue was with Honors Science which penalized him for being late with a portfolio so his final grade was a B(89) and not an A.  She would not give him any extra work work to earn an extra point.  This hurt his over GPA.

I like the Family Mentor program, my Family Mentor has been helpful in answering questions about CCA. One suggestion I have is if Family Mentors have the option of meeting with new families and actually walking them through the Connexus program to show them where everything is - it can be tricky to locate everything you need to see and keep track of, how to update things, work with the planner, run the scheduler, etc. Also, if your child needs help with his/her account or lessons, how to access your child's account. I'm not sure what all Family Mentors are permitted to do, but that might be useful, if they are allowed to meet with families and show them hands-on how to do things and model ways of keeping up with lessons, assignments, etc. Homeschooling can be isolating, so getting together with local CCA families can help with sharing ideas, motivation, and be inspiring.

We had a few bumps in the road at the beginning of the year with my sons IEP. His file was misplaced; he was put in gifted courses, then general education for all 4 main courses, and then finally put into the 180 courses for math and reading. \r\nCCA has met my daughters education needs by allowing her to work at her own pace and advance through 1st and 2nd grade quickly. She is now in 3rd and being challenged by the curriculum and thriving! \r\nAs great as CCA is a few things were difficult this year, the first being field trips. It was frustrating to find out that I couldnt pay for a 2nd field trip myself and then find out later that the field trip was not full to begin with. If we are willing to pay for a trip on our own and not cost the school anything, why would you turn students away? After all the complaining from other families that they couldnt get into field trips because they were all filled up, my children have not been on 1 field trip that was at its max this year. \r\nAlso, I find it frustrating my daughters third grade teacher does not send out  an update of what is being covered in class and what needs to be covered on her own or with a learning coach. For example, the 3B, Unit 2, lessons 1-5, the story Sukis Kimono teaches about editorials. The portfolio due on day 4 -instructs the students to write an editorial on why they think it is important to be yourself. My daughter watched the lessons but the teacher never went over any aspects of an editorial, even though the assessments 1-4 ask questions about an editorial. The elementary live lessons often times seem to only go over the stories and grammar, leaving out the extra details that are covered on assessments. It would be nice if they teacher mention these things when sending out a weekly email. Such as, please read or please watch the video in lesson 2, page 3 titled., I will not be covering this in lesson. \r\nThis issue makes me wonder if the teachers are even looking at the assessments. Another example Math 3B, Unit 2, lesson 1 is a practice review of basically improper fractions. Improper fractions were brought up briefly in the online lesson. I was shocked at the review because the problems did not even compare to the 2 examples given in the lesson. When I asked the teacher about it she had to look at the practice review to see what I was talking about. She was shocked that is what the practice review was on. Why are the teachers not going through the lesson assessments to see what the questions are? They are the teachers; it is their job to know what our students are being graded on. I cant tell you how many times I have had to go back to a teacher and ask, Why was this not addressed in class? Improper fractions are a big deal for 3rd grade. \r\n\r\nLike I said, I am overall please with CCA but there are a few things that need improved to make the students lessons time efficient. I wasted 20 minutes today trying to figure out why my daughter couldnt answer assessment questions on editorials only to find that her teacher never covered the topic. \r\n","1. CCA needs to work on the Special Education Department. The lack of communication is frustrating. The fact that the special education managers aren't aware of program and special services that CCA has to provide is concerning. I do not know if the problem lies in the quality of education and experience of the special education managers or if it is lack of training provided by CCA.\r\n2. Provide direct instruction 4 days a week for core high school courses for those students who struggle in reading and writing. Simply allowing accommodation for these classes is not enough. Elementary has multi-level programs for support and it seems that CCA forgot that learning struggles do not end when entering high school. I am personally concerned for my student for social studies and science. \r\n3.  Provide enrichment for students who tested well in iReady via software or weekly live lesson. \r\n4. The impact the PSSAs have on the students is burdensome. Teachers cancel live lessons altogether while only a few provide recordings on the material. \r\n5. Live lesson for social studies and science at the 3rd and 4th grade level twice a week. Our students have such potential of doing so much better in the middle school curriculum if they could have the enrichment from teachers and groups discussions based on the elementary curriculum. \r\n6. Career planning trips to tech schools or shops that do apprenticeships.  Many of our CCA students have learning disabilities and do not desire to go to a two or four year University or community college. Per Mike Row and Mike Row works, of the 5.5 million jobs available, 75% of them do not require a college degree. A major problem in our country is so many students with looming college debt and so few jobs in their area of study. These should not count towards monthly field trips. \r\n7. Allowing more than 1 paid field trips per a month.","At this time I really can't think of anything else you could help my family with but I will be keeping in touch with all of my support team,","Inform us of any advocates available for children which feel some teachers are not allowing flexibility in portfolios. My child has followed portfolio rubric and instructions and then failed because his teacher had decided she only wanted it a specific way. He had worked ahead and done everything properly, it was after she gave him the bad grade she sent instructions out saying she wanted it done only one way. This is frustrating, because I refuse to make my child redo a portfolio he did properly, just because a teacher wants only one way.\r\n","I cannot think of any other way than the what they do now to help.","At this point I can't think of anything.","N/A","Some of the staff/teachers don't know how to speak to people.

These teachers are also making LL mandatory when they aren't usually.","I like the way that I can be involved in my child school work and be able to help when needed but CCA can have the teachers help the students one on one once in a while and there grades be updated frequently because my child grades were the same all year and when we would call concerning this they said that they would call tech support but nothing was not done it made my son very upset and also made him feel why should I try when you don't make the effort to help him. Also he had problems concerning the percentages did not go up either due to he would score high on tests and lessons but they would not up the percentages to put up his grades so he felt why should I try. I don't like my son feeling this way and I like CCA but I think this should be looked into because it really concerned me and my son took responsibility and kept calling his teacher concerning this and it did not go anywhere.","I am happy with CCA .","I would like to feel the IEP meetings were better prepared for by the staff.

No comments here.","I can only compare the curriculum to one I know from being with K12 for 4 years. The things I loved were the Language and History program. The science program and math programs were comparable, however, CCA's science seems to be in constant repeat mode. I had seen it last year when my kids were all learning almost the same things in 2nd, 4th, and 6th grade and I see it this year in 3rd, 5th and 7th grade. It seems like they aren't really learning more things, just the same thing in a different way. I never noticed this with my other school. The phonics program at K12 is amazing and is the reason why I chose not to enroll my newest Kindergartener in CCA and instead enrolled her in PAVCS to utilize the K12 phonics. She was struggling to get her letters before and now is a great reader, I believe because of the Phonics program. The History program is excelled in the K12 curriculum. I love that they teach world history and Greek mythology as a story. It doesn't overwhelm the child like you would think. It's spoken as a story in a book. Children love stories and they see the stories as fun. I miss the LA and History from the K12, but I love the EdTech and field trips of this school and CCA has much better contact with families, so I have stayed. However, if there would be a change of curriculum coming soon, I'd love to see you have K12 as an option (maybe have more than one curriculum to choose from like some other cyber schools I've talked with), but in keeping with some kind of program that would also allow the students to learn the world of Microsoft, like the EdTech program. It would be amazing to have my cake (the curriculum) and eat it too (the amazing staff at CCA). Thank you for this opportunity to tell you my feedback.","Well, I know that you are separate from Connections Academy now and I truly believe that the K12 younger years program is superior to the Connections. In LA and History especially. I have used 4 different cyber school curriculums throughout my children's school years and I have found that the Phonics program though K12 is amazing. My last two children (I have 5 students and a 3 year old) have started in PAVCS with the K12 program solely because of their Phonics program. These two children have started the Kindergarten year with not really understanding the difference between all their letters and numbers. They call 6 a letter and A a number. They didn't know all their letters and had no understanding of how to form words. Within 6 weeks in the Phonics program, the change was amazing, and my \"now 2nd grader\" is a fluent reader. My kindergartener, who started this year, is well on his way to being an excellent reader as well. If there is anything I would change about CCA, it would be allowing the use of the K12 program and OLS system as an alternative to the curriculum it uses now. That way, I could have all my students (Again, I have 6 children total) in the same school, but be able to decide which curriculum would be best for each child. That would be the perfect school. I do understand that that would mean having teachers trained in both curriculums and possibly have a double set of staff for the K12 curriculum so that you could also offer content based classes, but you asked, and that would literally be a dream come true. My local school district actually has an online school that allows the choice of Connections and K12 and I have been tempted to switch, but the content based classes and the collection of teachers holds me from doing that. I do not believe that I would get the attention for my kids that I believe is important, utilizing the local school districts online school. I have mentioned the K12 curriculum to everyone who asks my opinion. Thank you.","I wish the curriculum was easier for iep students. I wish the assignments wouldn't stack up, it's very overwhelming. I also wish they were more specific to their needs. I feel that the curriculum is to hard for slower students. I also hate the fact that they have to go to the message boards for modified assignments. Everything NEEDS to be in one spot to make it easier for students with special needs and parents also. The assignments are not modified enough.","I wished that it was clear to me of the expectation of the course, it is so easy to fall behind it you struggle with test then the lessons pile up because you are restricted to move on then you wind up with overdue lessons.  So you are forever playing catch up.","I would like to see more field trips offered in our area","I felt like some of the teachers were a little easy on grading writing and projects. Others were tough, but fair.","Keep doing what you are doing!!","They do a great job all ready.","I don't have anything to request.","do a great job","No answer","eliminate Ed Tech for students who are doing well in all courses. My children and I feel that this course is very redundant","CCA has been great!  Only difficulty we have had is when contacting support for technical issues.  The help from technical support has not always been the best.","One way would be in the LL's,the teachers need to teach what is in that particular lesson.When that is not done it makes you have to choose, a much longer school day or not really going over that lesson in as much detail as you could have.We are big fans of LL's and attend daily,if it matched up better, i bet you would have more students attending. And i think if possible CCA needs to bring back Hersey Park trip,kids love to meet teachers and see other kids that attend,and it gives kids something to look forward to.","Iam happy with everything","No answer.","Continue the wonderful communication it already has. It is more than we ever received in brick and mortar public school.","Not sure.","I feel as if certain classes can be reworked and tailored toward the grade level relevant. For example, Social Studies and Art for Kindergarten students, for the most part is okay, but it has way too many videos that are not geared toward this age group and my son loses interest quickly. We have been able to find youtube videos and websites that help with some of these issues, but that has been my only concern throughout the year. I would love to see videos for the folklore section of this grade level as well. I found some videos on youtube for that class with my son and he loved them and got the references throughout that section right away with the rest of his work because of it. We really enjoy this school and the education programs it has to offer, the issues stated would be our only concern.","NONE","Better communication with parents and a better understanding within the organization of roles. I was told numerous times by numerous people, \"That's not my job\" until it came right around to the person who told me that to begin with. Knowing where to go with concerns would be very helpful - both educational concerns and other concerns.","take away some portfolios there are to many of them.","N/A","not sure","We need more art programs. It would be great to see art branch out and become a regular (or chosen elective). For example: A \"place\" where Concept Artists could stretch their talents as well as link it to Career Opportunities.","Allow the Highschool classes to be rescheduled in the scheduler like we can with the lower classes - We are able as parents to see that our kids are getting behind a bit only they can't make it up fast enough and it becomes sink or swim.... being able to run the scheduler allows them a chance to catch up without feeling overwhelmed. it allows us as parents to see what needs to be scheduled to allow them to graduate on time etc.. There needs to be  some help...My son is suffering after being very sick and now is so far behind he feels lost...with no end in sight. An honor student failing.","Better communication","provide testing for special education in a more reasonable time frame, provide more variety in Electives, not \"push\" college and career planning-college is not for every student !","The main reason that we are not returning next year is the dramatic decrease in the quality and number of field trips. The ones that are offered are subpar and not usually garnering enough interest from my student to make it worth the time to go. Combine that with no more end of year picnic and public school has too many advantages over CCA where that didn't used to be the case","There will always be things we don't like in any situation, but I feel that overall, we are well supported and when we need anything, we have been able to contact someone who has been very helpful!","It would be beneficial if there were more detailed help with learning to write well. Also, I find it difficult to balance having to hand-hold my kids to get their work done and letting them be responsible for completing tasks in a timely manner.","As far as the rules for the Community Reimbursement there needs to be rules in writing to give direction on what is reimburseable and what is not.","Keep on doing what you are doing.","I think CCA has a great foundation, however, there are some building blocks that need to be added to the foundation.  Communication is extremely important when your student is working in a virtual environment.  The teens in school today are very comfortable with technology, but very uncomfortable when it comes to picking up a phone and calling a teacher for help.  I have spoken with several parents recently and have found this to be true with both sons and daughters.  This generation does not want to ask for help and it almost paralyzes them to speak with someone on the phone.  They would rather speak face to face or use texting for communication.  I think it would be helpful for teachers to be staying on top of their students' grades and when they see that a student is falling behind, or has been struggling with quick checks, quizzes, or tests, the teacher should be reaching out to the student. (not waiting for the student to reach out to the teacher - that might not EVER happen)  \r\n\r\nHigh school students need to know that their teachers care about them and about their future - not that they have someone just trying to teach them something.  I think it would be helpful for \"regular\" LiveLessons - even when it is an \"elective\" type of class.  My daughter is in Sign Language and has been waiting 3 years to take that course - she was so excited to finally be a senior and get to take Sign Language.  However, she should not be teaching herself Sign Language. . . . . that's where the teacher needs to step in.  Having a LiveLesson 1 time in 4 weeks is not very practical.  At the very minimum, she should have 1 lesson with a teacher per week.  She spends several hours a week doing the work for that class but doesn't have any feedback, or any \"Live\" person/teacher to be speaking with about it. That's when being in a classroom in a building with a teacher would far outway cyber learning.  It's difficult to maintain that balance.","N/a","I think CCA does a fantastic job.","Live lessons for science and social studies in Kindergarten","n/a",":)","I find it confusing when the home page lists a student as approaching alarm when there has been contact and live lessons attended.","I do very much appreciate the  Work internship program.  That is also why my daughter is staying her senior year, for that opportunity (I forgot to mention).\r\nSo, I would say to continue growing that opportunity for the students to really do hands on work, which I think helps them decide what kind of job they may enjoy doing after schooling is done.\r\nMake more connections w/ job places to have more options lined up/easily accessible in different fields of interest for the students to apply for - in the work program/conservatory.\r\nMy daughter would probably also request more photography, or 'techy' type classes. As she pretty much took all classes offer re: to photography.\r\nOther wise, keep doing what you are doing!:)\r\nAnother thought -Graduation - maybe somehow make it more personal. Maybe a 'get together' of the graduating class in a certain area of PA to actually meet/social.?? I know my daughter is not necessarily looking fwd to grad d/t unfamiliar faces at present.","I have requested how to start an IEP for my child at least twice and received no answer back from her homeroom teacher.  It seems that while I was promised that her special needs could be accommodated, in reality, they cannot and that is very disappointing.  I have a brilliant kid who is very capable but she is failing because no one can seem to reach her.","There is nothing I would want changed.","t","There is nothing I can think of","Please re-visit field trip policy with regards to only being allowed to attend one paid field trip per month.  My daughter only went on 2 field trips this year (which is fine), but there were several field trips the same month that were of interest to her.  She was not allowed to attend both (even if we paid for one of them) because of this policy.  For next year, please consider having a yearly limit of field trips for students, so they could potentially take several the same month, if many of the field trips on the other months do not interest them.","Have seminars or classes for parents and students to come to so they can learn about the college process.\r\n\r\nAlso, re-evaluate the current field trip policy","I have been very satisfied with CCA.","Provide more guidance to students in high school.  I feel like my child is floundering - not sure what to do after school.  It would be helpful to have some classes for high school age students to talk about careers, schools, doing resumes, job interview practice, etc.  The STEM activities have been of help in some areas, but this year they seemed shorter, or farther away, and we were unable to get to most of them.  Several were over an hour away, so it is hard to travel that far for a STEM class that lasts 3 hours.  Harrisburg is a good area to have the STEM classes, and we still have a 50 minute drive (but very willing to go there), but several were north of Reading - over 1.5 hours away!  The Box of Light class was K-12 grade in the same classroom.  How can you teach effectively to that large an age span in the same classroom?  Field trips are geared more to younger students.","You already have so many resources and it's great.","Keep up the good work!","Provide consistent teachers throughout the year. My children go through two sometimes three different teachers.","not sure right now","I can't think of any except location for events.","not sure\r\n","none","Provide more social opportunities.","You are doing a good job the way it is.","I think things are good the way they are","Continue to be a great addition to the school system!","Just keep doing as is.","I believe CCA is  doing a fine job over all","They have done a wonderful job !","It would be helpful to have the \"College in the High School\" program active.  My daughter will be a senior next year and is planning to take 1 or more college courses at a local college during her senior year with CCA.  She took 1 college course this past fall, but did not get credit in CCA for it, and had to still take 6 credits with CCA in addition to a college course - that was a lot of work.","CCA does an excellent job, I have no complaints.","CCA does a great job, still deciding if this is the right fit for my daugher.  Depends on her commitment","We're very satisfied with the program!","not sure","CCA is great!","Adjust attendance for children with special needs that have aides come to the home. Especially when there is 2ft of snow on the ground. Children should be excused. It is out of their control. These children already have long full days. and to expect them to make up lost hours because an aide can not make if because of snow or is sick is ridiculous.  And NOT fair to the children.","more field trips in our area","Continue serving","Better questions on quick checks and especially tests. Many lean heavily being subjective or a best answer instead of one answer. I feel this leads to less suredness and remembrance for the students.","Everything is excellent already.","I am not sure.","Nothing at this time.","Again, being more open to testing and advancement would work better for our situation. While I understand that most advanced classes start in 3rd grade, there are exceptions to the rule, and some children will lose their curiosity and eagerness to learn if they are bored and not challenged. Math Club has been a life-saver for us as it gave him access to First In Math, which fills the gap for math to help him feel challenged and to get his brain working. Perhaps having more options listed, or a section for parents wanting to challenge their kids based on subject could be added?","I wish that the books that the kiddos read that are online(truck town friends, etc.) could be put into a database somewhere for easier access. My son is doing the book it program so sometimes he will want to reread a book that was online in a previous lesson, and it is hard to find you have to search through all of the lessons which can be tiresome.  Also with him being in grade K. Actual paper books are easier for him to read and follow along with, it would be nice if all of those books that are online only could be put into a binder or have someway of actually physically having them in front of the kiddos so the can point at each word and follow around the story better we tried to even print them at home and we weren't allowed to. A MOUSE!! I am sure my kiddo isn't the only one that cannot move and click on that silly pad. He is too young and has too small of hands, we had to go and buy a mouse after 2 days because he couldn't do smarty ants with out it.","The Special Education Department needs to provide better service and support to their learners.","One way is to send out better computers when their is an issue with one.  We had to exachange her computer 3 times this year.  There were issues with the battery, and other issues etc.  I feel that if the student has been in CCA for several years like my daughter has been, she should have been entitled to a new computer.  She got behind in all of her classes because of the computer issues not only once but 3 times.","since joining CCA we have heard a lot of complaints from other coaches/parents about portfolios, there seems to be many more this year and we don't allow our child to do them without myself or my wife physically being involved because of the vague guidelines my child has difficulty understanding what is expected so we seem to fall behind until we can find the time to devote to portfolios.  lessons should not freeze until portfolios are completed this just makes our child fall behind","Its #1 .... Everything is Excellent ! Thank you","CCA is great in what they do. Not sure how to answer that at this point.","Have more field trips for families in Berks County all of the trips are for families more away from us.","They have done a great job","The only difficulty we have being enrolled in CCA, is attending live lessons. Often my son goes with me to work and therefore he isn't home during live lessons or able to attend.","everything is good","Middle school teacher need to call more when children grades are falling and better help them make up work and a better understanding of work.","I am very happy with CCA","I am very pleased with everything.","Consolidate curriculum into one place. Teachers often work outside of connexus.","It would be nice if the student's didn't spend most of their time Testing instead of learning. They are repeatedly spending days testing in multiple ways. Multiple Benchmark tests, I-ready or study island, state testing, class testing. Also they have a very heavy class load and Too many portfolios. They can have all their classes to do, all the lesson work and 3-4 portfolios going at they same time! There is no way to get through it all in the time available and kids get burnt out FAST (so do the parents).","na","My 2nd and 4th graders were not placed with teachers that are local to them. I think they would have more of an opportunity to meet them on field trips if they were.","I think CCA does pretty good as is. I cannot really think of anything.","Nothing.","No suggestions at this time.","Only one time we had an issue with a teacher/staff member and its being taken care of. The staff and teachers love the kids and want to help them with anything they may need from learning to the students needs.","I think CCA is great and I don't know how it can be better.","offer an ROTC program","Don't have as any portfiolio","N/A",null,"Make it easier to work with multiple students. It is sometimes a very long day trying to get three children through all of their lessons.","I would like to know more about the differences between elementary and junior high, as far as class structure and independent learning goes. We had a friend who went to CCA for 6th and 7th grade and it concerns me as to what was expected from her. It seemed very minimal homework was required and the portfolios were less difficult and less detailed than what my daughter, who was in 4 and 5th was doing. I'm not sure if the friend wasn't doing what was expected or if the school's expectations and requirements of the student lessen in junior high.  I also hear that the science program is not independent learner centered and everything is taught from the classrooms. This type of structure will not work for my daughter as she learns from hands-on experience.  I would appreciate information prior to next year so that we can make adjustments where necessary.","you guys are great, my son can be difficult sometimes to do his works, but the teachers are great and understanding...","We are doing fine and my child is learning a lot more than she would in private schooling.","I think CCA is doing a wonderful job","The quality, close proximity, and variety of field trips is dwindling from past years.  Although the field trips are now coordinated across the areas of the state, there are considerably less unique experiences.  Opportunity to enjoy experiences as a family has been taken away with the reduction of learning coaches from 2 to 1.  I would prefer to be able to pay for extra field trips when they don't fill up.  Some months we might like to take more trips, and others we are too busy for any, a more versatile field trip management system could be advantageous.  With the change in STEM Conservatory events this year, and bringing them under the 1 paid umbrella idea, we were only able to attend one this year.  They had been a highlight for my older child the previous year and he attended most of them.  The duration was usually 9am-3pm, like a regular school day, which we prefer and the drop off format.  I have lots of ideas I could share to expand deeper learning experiences and ways the school could offer specific perks for certain age groups without increasing cost by a great amount.","fewer portfolios.  In the learning process I understand projects are needed, but the number of portfolios in the elementary curriculum is ridiculous.  Especially, kindergarten,","Offer activities in Philadelphia that are of high interest on a regular basis, like culinary and theater.","more inter active lessons.","You have been extremely helpful to my grandson. I am his coach and always check his work at the end of the day ,to make sure he is staying on top of things. The teachers are great. Just wish there were not so so many portfolios all due at the same time in each subject. It can be overwhelming for the student.","Just keep doing what your doing. This school is great!","Allow asynch students to have access to live lessons if there is a need. I understand that they are asynch because they do not attend live lessons, but access to recordings from another teacher would be great in case there is a lesson or two the student would like to watch. \r\n\r\nAlso, I prefer the previous years' way of handling field trips. Only one paid per month is difficult when there are so many my students would like to do. There are many field trips being cancelled because of lack of interest. It is a shame that the students who would like to go on them can't because they are limited to just one field trip.","Not sure. Everything has been great.","OOps I mentioned this already, but having some kind of meet up activities with other CCA kids in the Lancaster area on a regular basis (maybe at the Lancaster City library or a public park like Lancaster Central Park (maybe for nature walks/learning/writing in science journals) would be great.","if the teacher could start texting a students that has cell phones, students may reply quicker.","through out the many years you all have been extremely helpful .it is a great school with many great and caring teachers. (especially if student has some health issues).  thank you all","It would be much more enjoyable if the students didn't have so many portfolios. The amount of portfolios (and the amount of time the majority of them take) is getting crazy. Plus they seem to clump and be several in one week. I would also love to have more notice when a portfolio is modified or dropped. Cyber schools are supposed to provide flexibility. It is almost impossible to work ahead because of the portfolio modifications and when they are dropped. It is not fair for students that work ahead.","Very happy with the contacts I have made with staff as well as the curriculum.","We are very satisfied","CCA does a good job listening and finding solutions; I feel very happy because I feel that I'm part of a team.","I think the high school classes should be more frequent.  I believe they need live lessons at least 4 days a week in all subject areas.","I can't think of anything at the moment.  We are really satisfied with the program.","no comments","Better and timely communication with staff and administration.  I have a special needs student and communication though a bit better  lately has been terrible.  Teachers have been a bit better than working with administration.     This year has been down right frustrating.  In prior years communication was excellent.    I have been greatly disappointed.  My son attended CCA  grades 1,2 and 5, the communication at the elementary level was fantastic.  My son gets to middle school,6th grade,  everything falls apart.  It looks like one talks to each other and then also doesn't get back to the parent.   I hope it will improve for the coming school year.","To be able to contact the staff when needed with out always leaving messages and waiting for return phone calls.","CCA has been a wonderful experience for my daughter, they have done everything in their power to make sure she is able to graduate on time!","As of right now I am very satisfied with CCA","It works as-is","Can't think of anything. We are very satisfied.","Have a history an science class for learning support kids.","For now, CCA has done more than I ever imagined for my son and my family.  Because CCA goes above and beyond, I'm enrolling my daughter for next year to start Kindergarten.  I have given CCA's information to many people in many different situations.","It is sad to see how much of the flexibility is gone. When we started it was much easier to move at our own pace now if you don't follow the teacher exactly you may find you have done the wrong project(portfolio) or that the assignment has been changed. Schedules and lessons should be set at the start of the semester and any changes noted. There may be a reason a student works ahead (medical problem, family issues, vacation different from CCA schedule) This has been made very difficult and it used to be very easy. Daily live lessons are nice but if you attend all live lessons, many days 4-5 there is little time to complete work not covered unless you do 8 hour school days. One of the reasons for switching to CCA was to shorten my child's day (No bus ride, time lost o lunch and changing classes) I understand the school day should be 5-6 hours but when you are spending that much time in live lesson per day without completing the lesson it drags the day out to easily 7-8 hours. More flexibility would definitely be better.","One suggestion would be to offer more opportunities for the children to get together. I often hear children speaking about the difficulty of making friends and socializing. There are MANY wonderful places in our town that offer free, fun, educational experiences! Another suggestion would be to allow the teachers to have a high amount of input regarding the curriculum. Many of these teachers have been with CCA for years and I believe they have earned your trust and should be given the freedom to teach and test in the best way they know how.","CCA does a good job","Provide more choices in Humanities classes.","Not sure","Better curriculum for foreign languages.","The questions on the tests need to be more clear. They are too confusing especially in Math when they can take the question more than one way. Pictures for measuring need to be from the side not offset diagonally so they don't know how long it is. The questions on things need to be more specific.","Make more field trips available in Montgomery County. This year we didn't get many at all. I also have an issue with the current way that paid field trips are dealt with. I understand the school can only pay for one trip per month per child but I think that if a family is willing to pay for another one then they should be allowed to pay for the whole thing in order to go. At times there are field trips scheduled in a month in two different areas that are paid for that would be good for my children but because we cannot go to more than one we have to chose. This issue needs to be addressed. I have heard this complaint from other families also so I know I am not the only one.","Everything is fine right now, we just enrolled in program about 1 month ago","Not a thing I can think of right now.","I am very happy.","I wrote an email addressing my concerns and was never acknowledged or answered, not even with a basic form letter, which is very unprofessional. Spoke to someone in admin who promised to add more field trips in our area (free and paid), that didn't happen. No one in the administration of CCA appears to care about addressing concerns other than through placating lip service.","I feel CCA is perfect!","I am happy with everything at this time.\r\n","Better study guides.\r\nBetter consistency between modified tests and on-line versions of tests for kids with an IEP.\r\nBetter communication from staff ( I was not notified that my son's learning support teacher was no longer his LST!). \r\nMore tools tailored for kids with IEPs. Specific, targeted study guides; visuals; simplified words to help kids better understand what they read,","I am very happy with CCA at this time.","We love CCA and since we are fairly new, we feel we are being served appropriately.   Thank you!","The course content needs to be addressed. In our course there is a place to make comments on that specific lesson. I am told people read them, but I have never seen any changes. For instance, last year and this year, I have requested a comment box in the drop box for portfolios. In some cases, I need to make a quick comment to the teacher about my child's project. If a comment box was there, the teacher would see the comment when they were grading the project. Instead I need to separately email the teacher and then they need to go into the drop box to see what I need. It is extra work. There have been several science projects that were not planned correctly in the seasons. For instance one was to use 3 different soils (not provided) and no stores carried all of these. In the spring or end of fall they would, not winter.","My biggest complaint is the curriculum. I think it needs some work. Now that my oldest have been here for 3 years and we had experience 2 years at a K-12 school, I realize I like the K-12 curriculum better. I think CCA is far better overall. However, for science and social studies, we seem to be going over the same things every year. I noticed this year that my gifted daughter in 4th barely reads science because she knows it already. Science is not her favorite subject so she doesn't do extra work on her own. I understand it builds on each other, but I wish there was more. Art and science experiments seem exactly the same. For instance both my 1st and 4th grade had to make pinch pots. 4th grade have been asked to design something more involved.  This year 4th grade had to have PA state history which was a great idea, but this class was designed for HS students. There was too much information given, even I couldn't remember it all. It overwhelmed my gifted student and I know all levels of kids had to take this class. When we were in K-12 we learned about actual roman history and greek mythology. It was too much for 1st grade but this would be good for older students. Also, the book selection this year for reading was way off. The 4th grades were given an easy read picture book of Into the Sea, which they are reading now at the end of the year. It takes 5 minutes to read. However, this is after them getting a chapter book of the Mixed Up Files. The easy book should have been in September. Also, I did not like the Mixed Up Files. Have you read it? There is too much talk of a boys underwear and privates, 2 pages on a Marijuana joint, and the kids ran away from home and nothing bad happens to them. I don't need something tragic, but they don't even get in trouble or feel as if they are sorry. There are so many other books to read. I didn't realize this but after talking to other parents, their kids didn't need to complete these lessons. They complained. It was skipped.","I have noticed a lot of common core lessons integrated into the lesson plan.  These lessons are not included in the answer key to the learning coach.  The teachers also do not have access to the answers to these lessons.  I would like to see the answer key for these lessons included in the teaching materials.\r\n\r\n2 day lessons are very confusing and cumbersome in Connexus.  It would be easier to just have it set up as two lessons instead of simply telling you that you have two days to complete the lesson.\r\n\r\nSince flexibility is important to me and my family, I would like to see more flexibility with check-in calls.  Having a late afternoon or evening option would be helpful.","Not having to log out of the student/parent to go to the parents/students website.  Allowing us to keep moving through all the lessons not having to stop for the B simestor.","CCA is meeting all of our expectations.","dropping all phapleio class projects","Many times what the teacher teaches does not match the assignment in the planner.  This has been an ongoing frustration and has led to several instances when my daughter is taking quizes with information not covered in class or reviews are done after the planner has her taking her test.  She has also had to webmail several teachers on several occasions to remind them about uploading lessons, extra credit that was completed, but not credited, and follow through on study island problems.","Way to many portfolios and they count for to high of the grade.","Keep doing what you are doing.  Completely satisfied with CCA.","Get your teachers to return webmails  and calls","None","CCA can open a location in the Allentown/Bethlehem area, to make it easier for those of us living in these towns, who are not able to travel to the other locations. It will help our students who live in these towns to have access to teachers, administrators, tutors, special events going on within the school, and other students.","At this time I do not have any comments.","Keeping up the good work with the students","They cant because they serve me very well now","CCA is great","The \"alarm\" status is a pain in the but.  It seems like no matter how many live lessons my child attends or how on target we are , we are always in alarm and the response time after telling someone takes up to a week, if at all!\r\n","Increase communication between Administrators and Teachers.","I have no complains","Qick responces","You're doing a great job.","I'm truly satisfied","So far I can't think of anything.","Have car pooling to field trips for families without transportation.","My daughter needs a special education cuz she has adhd is really hard for her to learn is the first time that her grades falling like this in regular school she has A , B or C and I am worried about her grades now.","When we first started looking at Cyber schools the biggest issue was finding a school that didn't depend on common core.  My son is in special education and he just doesn't get it , no matter how often it is explained.  This year is math is entirely common core and he is struggling.  We have to relearn and explain things to him EVERY DAY so he can do it the common core way.   When I teach him the way I was taught he \"gets it\".  I think he should be graded on can he do the math..... NOT can he do the math the common core way.   Two totally different things.","Just help me get through the year with my child.","Have more learning centers around me.","I don't feel there are any other ways CCA could better serve me.","By helping my son get as much help he can get.","my daughter has ADHD is hard for her understand instructions and her grades are really bad never she has this issues before also she always have good grades. I hope that you guys help me with it.","Some teachers need to have better availability.","I would love it if CCA could help facilitate more interaction among students so that there could be a bit more social engagement.","Connect families of kids in similar grades or classes so there could be an option to do a science lab together or study together from time to time.  This has been isolating even though our familiar coordinators have tried to gather families.  It would just be nice to know if a child in my child's classes lived nearby.","At this time I am fully satisfied with CCA and the education he is receiving.","I don't think there is any aspect that needs improvement.","I am very satisfied with CCA- I cannot think of any aspect that needs improvement.","More live lessons throughout the day.","I am extremely satisfied with every aspect of CCA.","I have a few concerns about my families whole experience with CCA.","It would be nice if there were more student contact with the teachers and more of an incentive for my student, who has some social anxiety, to engage with their online classroom.  With that being said, CCA's flexibility has allowed an non gender-conforming teen to continue their high school education as they go through some difficult years of self-realization.  Our own public high school offers an online option, but no teachers, no honors courses, and no AP courses- so CCA was perfect for a smart, motivated student going through a difficult time.","Just keep doing what they're doing, I am very happy with everyone and the interest they show for my children.","you guys do fine now","Get rid of those iready tests! They are too frequent and not suited for most childrens grade level. My child is very intelligent, gifted, and it is ridiculous to ask an 8 year old about a 12th grade statistics problem in the math iready. These tests are not assessing grade level. They are a fishing expedition to see if a child can guess correctly under duress.","Unsure.

Everything has been great for us.","The availability of field trips in our region is limited. It would be nice to have more opportunities for local trips.","N/A","I think the curriculum could be changed a little. There should be more online interactive content that can be graded and less portfolios and quizzes and quick checks.","Not really sure what they do is already enough in my opinion","Not sure","You could simplify the field trip enrollment process as I explained in a previous question.  There are also certain field trips that get more interest than others so that not everyone gets an opportunity to participate.  Perhaps you could offer those trips more than once each year so that everyone who wants to participate would get a chance.  Obviously you would only allow students to go on the same trip once each year.  (for example - DaVinci Center, Crayola Experience)\r\nYou also need to find a better PA History class that includes a text book.  The PA History class for the fourth grade was horrible!","I think there needs to be more opportunity for live tutoring. I think that given how big the Lehigh Valley is we should have a center here and not Andreas. Would like to have the opportunity to have groups social skills in our area. I would also like to have an opportunity to drop off my child for learning experience where I don't have to be 100 there or nearby so I can have a break. It is challenging to be with your child 100 percent of the time especially if they are special needs.\r\n","I would love to see more choices for electives at both the high school level and especially middle school. We have had a very positive experience with the school so far and really don't have any major areas for concern. The Special Ed department is what makes this the right school for us. They have gone above and beyond to help my kids be successful!","Some of the teachers need to remember that this is a cyber school, kids are not in a regular classroom setting. Math teachers need to slow down a bit while they are teaching their lessons. Kids like to take notes and understand what they are doing in order to obtain good grades. Kids cannot accomplish that if the teacher does not give them the opportunity to do it.","I was this schools biggest cheerleader up until this year. Since separating from Connections Education, it seems like the teachers workload/student load has increased. We sometimes wait several weeks for things to be graded. My child's IEP has not been followed for 3 months now - they are not receiving related services in their IEP.","I loved everything about CCA last year 2015/2016 I had no complaints. This new structure of a flipped classroom for high school is awful this year for a special needs student. My son has stopped enjoying the academic part of school where he loved it. I have stopped recommending CCA based on this curriculum. This new team teaching is extremely disorganized. Most teachers are not following my son's IEP anymore.  If it goes back to the old way I would be happy to recommend once again.","Some teachers need to use effective learning strategies so students can learn faster and easier.","have more structured live lessons with the teachers that are assigned to my student. Too many live lesson options with different teachers can get confusing.","CCA is amazing. The teachers are great, the live lessons are extremely helpful, I couldn't ask for more.","It is nice of you to ask, but seriously, I can't think of anything.

Way too many per course per year!!!","The one struggle we've had this year is the antiquated Connexus system.  The web design is terribly poor and is not suited for the quality of computers issued.  This leads to a poor user experience for the students(&amp; parents).  Each lesson requires too much scrolling and panning.  The screen size is so small at times that you can not see questions and the multiple choice answers without scrolling back and forth.  User experience testing needs to be done to evaluate the system.  The poor web design is frustrating and compromises the validity of the school with its outdated system. \r\nAll programs should run in the browser, not requiring installation (ie:activity tracker, tux paint, etc.).","just continue what they are doing","Connexus needs an overhaul.  It is not user-friendly.  There are too many categories and oddly-named tabs.  It needs a search button on the main page.  I challenge you to do a user-experience test with someone who has no experience with the site.  There is a huge learning curve to finding things which makes it challenging for new families.  We are in our second year and I cringe when I have to locate something on the site.","Do not know","CCA meets my and my daughter's needs. I would like for her to attend field trips and social events but that is because she is shy about not knowing anyone, not because of lack of offerings.

Your grading process and her mom's lack of concern reinforces these poor work habits she is developing.","I don't know.","N/A","I have a better stability from CCA than I did public school.  My son struggled to want to even leave the house due to nasty adult attitudes at public school.  He really likes his teacher here.  She also helps to remind that though he thinks it's bad that a grade drops: she reminds him some things are harder than others.  That it doesn't mean that grade will stay down.  It's really comforting to have wonderful personalities and help that is positive.","CCA is an excellent school. Improvement is needed for the live lesson recordings (which tend to freeze and continuously get stuck), and for the Discovery Education videos that could not be viewed in the lessons. My daughters look forward to the videos; they are disappointed when the videos do not work.","Nothing I can think of now","My children and I are very satisfied overall with CCA.","More special ed support for my daughter","I feel CCA is doing a good job providing for my children and their education.","Everything has always been great the past 3 years. This is the first year that we were disappointed. A teacher in my daughters Social Studies class was \"re-writing\" history telling the students that those involved in the tea party were bad people, and that the 2nd Amendment really doesn't mean what it says. Downing our Forefathers....The teacher also was telling the students that the black people arrested and treated unfairly by police are terrible police officers. (the latest stories/riots) She even named the names of those \"treated unfairly\" which is are controversial topics. This teaching is poison, instilling in these kids heads that policemen are horrible people.  She posted a song, \"One Nation Under a Groove\" When a student said that it is One Nation Under God, the teacher told the student that it wasn't true. There was more, but I can't think of it right now.  I was going to call in about this, but the teacher never posted these L.L., so I didn't have proof. (The teacher posted maybe 3-4 L.L. a month) I think that maybe a parent said something because the teacher now teaches at the school cubicle (we can hear other teachers) instead of home. Things have calmed down. For next year, I would love to see mandatory posting of L.L.each day from the teachers. I will admit, I was looking elsewhere for my child's education for next year. I've NEVER had problems in the past. I'm giving it one more year in hopes that teachers will be accountable to the school board in what they teach. Besides that, we have/had been extremely happy with the school in the past years.","Start teaching typing and keyboard placement before teaching different Microsoft programs.","Nothing that I know of.","I think one option that could be looked into is: Try to group children from class that are closer to each other in proximity (area wise) so they might be able to get together more locally. For instance, play dates in the park, or local library trips, or even groups to the movies. Optional of course, but it would be something to think about.","N/A","no comment","My son struggles with the curriculum and it takes a long time to get through assignments and we quickly fall behind.","you are doing an excellent job so far","I'm not sure I'm pretty happy","we never got to go on any of the field trips because they were never on my page can u help with that?","Our needs are being met. :)","Overall, we are very happy!","I absolutely love CCA.  The teachers and administration promptly return my emails and answer my questions.  The only issue I have right now is that some of my son's credits didn't transfer correctly and I haven't heard back from anyone.  I will  just try to call again.","I do not like the courses like Intro to Computers &amp; Tech (IC3), where the teachers are out of state and do not hold livelessons.  This has been an extremely difficult class, with NO modifications (my daughter has an IEP).  I wish more courses weren't so \"reading heavy\" . . . there should be more interaction within a lesson.","I am very happy with CCA.","More live lessons later in the day","Counselor response could be faster and more formal.  My child will be a senior next year and the major thing I am worried about is the counselors involvement in the college application process as current response time to emails and how they are just one liner responses does not seem professional and makes me nervous as counselors are a key part in the application process","n/A","The administrators and staff (eg. AAs) seem very overwhelmed to me.  Paperwork takes a very long time (often months) and phone/email responses can also take a long time.  Perhaps more staff is needed?\r\nI also felt the field trip quality was lower this year.  Perhaps this is because my child is getting older and there is less available/appropriate choices for him; however, this spring in particular seemed to offer less options and more redundancy overall.","I have always liked CCA and so have my children but this year we were a little disappointed in the teachers not all the teachers just some.","Thanks for all you do! \r\n\r\nThe one thing I would love to see return is the reimbursement of college classes (dual-enrollment).","It already is a great school","Wish a mentor could of came to our house to help with the beginning process","doing fine","more activities near bucks county","simply update the homepage regularly with any and all relevant information","I believe this kind of school is ok for some children but not for others","I would like to know who my kids guidance counselors are.

Thank you.","More local trips so the kids can meet.","The amount of portfolio projects were overwhelming!  These were very labor intensive and time consuming for my 2 third graders and it was extremely difficult to keep up with the sheer number of these.  Once you get behind, there are always more coming which creates a feeling of never being able to catch up.","They have done everything they can to serve me.","Would prefer to still have live lessons on Wednesdays in core classes like math and language arts.  Less portfolio projects for elementary grades.","The Special Education Department needs to support my child's academic needs that have been clearly identified.","I think CCA should have newly enrolled families broken into 2 categories. Families who are new to homeschooling and families who aren't. As a family who has been homeschooling for some years, I feel that the communication and phone calls are very overwhelming. I get that the school wants to help, but the constant calls are annoying and it takes us away from what we are doing.","CCA should really consider dropping the number of portfolio's. They can be overwhelming, and they throw us off track. Also, I don't think my child's grade should be affected if he doesn't do skills tutor. If he doesn't do it, but does well with the work itself, his grade is lowered, when he does do it however, he doesn't receive any kind of extra credit for it. CCA also needs to think about adding more courses for high school. This is the main reason my 8th grader won't be back. There are not enough courses to choose from to keep her interested for 4 years.","Continue to offer support to the children and to the parents as well.","We have been with CCA, for a long time now.

A way to work on the road - make the LLs compatible with mobile devices, ipads, kindles, phones. CCA should SUPPLY DATA SERVICE so that we can continue to do work on laptops and attend live lessons while traveling to and from Drs. appts/therapy and field trips. 2. Inform teachers that many us enrolled our children in CCA for the flexibility, otherwise we would be in a B&amp;M. They shouldn't penalize kids for working ahead (we lost 25 pts the first week of school for doing a quick check), or penalize kids for not attending LLs by only announcing important info during class. Teachers need to utilize their message board and should give changes/drops in a timely manner (dropping Ports a day before they are due - again penalizing students that work ahead or just want to get a head start). 3. Ports should show up the day you start them instead of the day due, allowing students to work on them and continue doing their daily work. 4. Let LCs know where students should be in the course opposed to where they actually are or SAY they are. Turn the lesson on the calendar or Course Tree RED. The teachers kept telling the kids to ignore their scheduler, just follow along with LLs - the scheduler was useless this year. 5. A better website would be great. Something more cohesive, where you could get to everything CCA from one page. 6. My niece is thinking of doing B&amp;M for 9th-12th because High School at CCA seems like such a mystery and scary. I'm even anxious about the major changes between MS and HS. We are already testing and applying to several schools. Give us reasons to stay. 7. We love Field Trips, keep working at making them better and do a better job of selling them to the parents. Allow us to attend more paid trips if spots are still open/if we pay. STEM trips should always be open to all. 8. If we travel to field and stem trips, are we eligible for discounted Public Transportation fares like B&amp;M offers? This would be great for those that can't or won't drive.","I'm happy with everything","In a perfect world, I'd live close to one of the drop-in centers, so my child could work alongside other CCA students on projects, homework, etc. (and have somebody besides just me reminding him to get things done). After 3 years, my student has definitely gotten in a \"home school\" groove, and transitioning back to brick-and-mortar school, or even to a workplace, will be more difficult.","By replacing the portfolios with something else, they are too intense and there are too many back to back tests and quizzes, I know I can run the scheduler to change things but in the end they all need to be completed and it's a bit overwhelming.  I work from home and I like for my 4th grader to get his work done during normal school hours, not later after I am done work or on the weekends because we all need time to relax. So I find myself doing 2 jobs, working from home and continuously needing to monitor my son to be sure he is not skipping past work and needing to help him with things he may be having trouble with which that is what I am suppose to do but it's tough when I have to meet my work obligations also at the same time---so CCA seems to be geared more for non-working parents.","The portfolios can be a bit much &amp; during PSSA or Keystone season not give as many lessons so children can study for those test.","Unsure at the moment","We have very few complaints.  Those I had were taken to Mr. Fraser and together we worked them out. I can't thank CCA enough!  Cyber school is pretty much our only answer between my disability and my children's abilities. This is our first year dealing with the gifted department. Until now, abilities were addressed through promotion to the next level or modifying curriculum.  We had some issues with the teacher, but they are still being addressed with Mr. Fraser.Recommendations I could make would be - more Live Lessons (enrichment?) for those who are ahead with lessons or above grade level, study skills &amp; time management (I'm actually teaching my children this myself since it's clear they now need it). My disability keeps us from field trips during the winter months when my pain is at its worst. While I appreciate the field trip policy of one paid trip per month, it would really help us if we could bank field trips on the months we are housebound due to my health and then use those banked days during the spring months when we can travel. I know this will probably never happen, but I have to share my thoughts especially since I know other parents at CCA with similar health problems.  I would like to see a program where there is less waste when it comes to school supplies being sent out. We have years when we get the same kits for math and science or head phones that we already have.  We put them aside for if they're needed, but this does seem to create a situation where money could be spent more wisely. I had criticism about my 1st grader's mid-year testing that I webmailed Mr. Fraser and her teacher about previously. I would be happy to share that webmail if requested.","Make it so the lessons in the planner coincide with live lessons so that my child can work through them during the live lessons instead of doing both. My daughter enjoys LLs, but because she still has work to do in the workbook, textbook, Skills Tutor, portfolios, studying for tests, assessments, etc. she often has to do schoolwork on weekends and feels like she's working all the time. She's in ballet 9-12 hours a week, and while we like the flexibility, doing both the live lessons and lessons in the planner, she almost never has days off. She's exhausted, and I'm exhausted too. I have heard that other teachers do things differently, so maybe it's a teacher thing.","Tutors would be a blessing and my child would get much needed help on focusing.","They need to offer more trade school curriculum to prepare them for a non-collegiate education.","We are happy with the service.","I would like to see more practice in all subjects.","N/A I'm satisfied.","I am completely satisfied with CCA nothing needs to change.","Better communication throughout the school year including prior to the start of school. I find sometimes the teachers do not adequately and clearly explain my child's learning progress and programs involved in learning.","I think that everything at CCA is perfect","Improve your special education services. Consider creating a special education community for other similarly circumstanced families.","Like I said everything has been great... Thank you CCA","I wish the environment of the Live Lessons was more quiet","do not shortchange the students and reduce the number of credits to graduate","Keep providing physical therapy and other learning support that are need after his long\r\nbattle with a medical issue.","It was sometimes hard to complete everything in the lessons, as well as attend the live lessons each day.  There didn't seem to be enough time in the school day to complete everything. Perhaps cut back on some of the lesson activities in each lesson.","Every thing is great.","The multi-teaching program is not working very well in all of the subjects. This program creates confusion at times with different opinions when grading in English for writing paragraphs.","More contact from the teachers.","- Make the class trip message boards easier to navigate, and have more trips in lower bucks county.  - Try to follow traditional public school calendars for days off (a full week off for spring break, for example).  - Try to make the lessons less overwhel","Better software and hardware. The technology lags behind at tims and slows down the learning process.","am ok","Right now keep doing what you are doing.","Update the computers/laptops students use.","Continue this learning style.","There is one thing I really dislike and that is the portfolios. Some of them are okay, but some are very, very confusing, complicated and take up entirely too much time. I don't like it when my kids can't go forward until they complete the portfolio; they tend to get too far behind and it's overwhelming for them.","If a child completes the A portion of a class and then transfers to a different class and does not take the B portion, their A portion grades should not disappear or become irrelevant. They received a semester grade and it should stand.","Provide more vocational and home economics classes.","Build a staff that's invested in the best educational experience for each child and their families.","it is fine","There are several things that need to change.  First, make sure all of your teachers have degrees and actually know how to teach the subject that you place them in charge of. Second, get rid of the teachers who are not teaching and seem to care not one bit about whether the children are learning or if the parents are happy with their learning style. Specifically, Ms. Lauren Brady the 4th grade Gifted Talented teacher, has no business teaching. She has poor grammar, and thinks laughing will make her appear to be less of a fool. She needs to go. Also, Mrs. Nicole Oechler, a 6th grade teacher, has poor contact with parents and students, does not make phone calls, and takes extremely too long to respond to emails sent to her. Lastly, I think that if you want children to better grasp the material, you should stop teaching these strange new styles which expect children to best estimate an answer instead of solid actual responses. There are also assessments in which children are expected to choose the correct answer on an assessment in which the question is based on an opinion. This is a major problem that I have seen is ongoing. The assessments are not based on factual answers, they are based on whomever wrote the test's own personal opinion. Once someone actually takes the time to get these problems corrected, there will be a lot more learning, and far fewer issues to deal with throughout the school year.","It would be nice if someone would have reached out and offered the opportunity for our 9th grade student to take the SAT.  I have heard nothing about the National Honor Society and my son is a straight A student, athlete, and involved with the community.  I am unsure what the guidance counselors actually do since none of them have ever reached out to our family in all of the years we have been with CCA but especially now that my child is in high school.  What services does CCA offer that makes it a better choice than other cyber charters?  I find it very disappointing that as a parent of a CCA student I am never reached out to and I am involved in nothing any more.","CCA has been the perfect solution to our family situation. My son is a pre professional dancer and CCAs flexibility allowed him to keep up with his training and was awarded a total of $148,000 in college scholarships. This WOULD NOT have been possible at a traditional high school so CCA served us PERFECTLY!","I love cca","Fix some of there teachers","Make sure all teachers are there for the right reason.Make sure they aren't saying negative things to students","Our experience with orientation was non existant. We drove in the rain for about 2 hours only to get there and be told to go online and figure it out. The computer for my son to learn how this way of schooling goes wasn't working properly so I was taken through quickly and told to go on and start reading and I'd be good. We are still figuring things out. About the only thing my son got out of the trip was that we were told that a live lesson counts as an hour and the lesson / assessment for the day counts for an hour, no matter how long it actually takes. So it is a fight all the time between us that a 20 minute live lesson amd a 20 minute 5 question assessment isn't enough work for the day.\r\n  I will probably keep my son in CCA next year, but mainly because of the electives, which are way better than the district school, and we have a friend of my sons signing up next year, so hopefully they can work together and improve their understanding of the process and the subjects. \r\n  I also am totally confused about the whole \"Alarm\" system. It makes absolutely no sense to me. And although my sons homeroom teacher tries to justify it, I still don't get it. She says that its better interaction with the teacher, but if he doesn't ask questions and she doesn't call on him for an answer then it seems to me that it is the same as watching the recorded lesson. \r\n  I put my son in this environment because he doesn't ask questions, he seems intimidated by the teachers so I thought that not actually being there would help. A few of his teachers do call when they see him struggling, but he will never initiate a call to talk to his teachers, again because of his being intimidated.           Matt is a very bright kid but you can't tell from his grades, but they were no different at his home school and he has a better elective oppurtunity at CCA.  That is not how I wanted to feel about this experience, that its no better than his district school, I really wanted this to be all it was hyped up to be.\r\n  Personally I think that there are alot of extra carricular activities that don't benefit my son, maybe others get more out of it, I wish he had more \"time\" with instruction from his teachers, how many field trips does 1 kid need. They go on 1 field trip a year in our district, personally that is not a draw for us. I'd like to see more instruction from the teachers. Most of his classes don't even have daily live lessons, so the 20 minute assessment is the only instruction daily and that just isn't enough.  But because my son was told that that 20 minutes counts as an hour he feels like it's enough, then he struggles on his tests.\r\n  I was expecting more.","The teachers can write back to you faster","na","I put my son in cyber school because he doesn't ask for help where needed. It was my understanding that the teachers would contact him via webmail if they see he is struggling. I don't expect every teacher to contact every student every day, but if they see him struggling then reach out to him. If he doesn't respond, contact the coach. Some teachers put a response on t he quizzes and tests telling him what was right or wrong but that is after the fact.\r\nMy student had a bad experience early on with a teacher amd since then he struggles with trusting that they won't call him out or humiliate him because he has different opinions than the teacher, so I thought that since rhere is no \"classroom\" then he would feel safer, but that didn't happen, and yes I do consider that a teacher problem. I contact teachers with questions and they answer to me, not to the student.","I don't have any ideas; I think the way things are going now are just fine.","I am currently extremely satisfied but I miss the end of year field trip including all students and teachers","n/a","I can't think of any other way that CCA hasn't already thought of.

I have only spoken to 1 of them this year. Understood that I can reach out to them, but it would be nice to feel that they want to know about Emmeline. Since she is on track, there is very little communication.","Respond to Special Ed better.","Make some things easier to be able to get to we live in Bucks County and I really don't go into Philly ,when they do picture day and the book van and things like they don't even come close to where we live, there are places in Langhorne Pa., That have areas you can make it more convenient, I feel like my child misses out because field trips aren't that convenient either,some people can't drive to Harrisburg or all over , I have to work and I don't get that much time off to be driving all over,what about looking into a bus for field trips ?\r\n","give more information to parents","not sure","Not sure","right now it seems at the 11th grade level they are having a hard time retaining teachers, not sure what that is about.  Plus using outside teaching aids like KHAN academy is not helpful...or having children sign up at outside lesson plans that are not planned or set up by the teacher (they are just being used by the teacher).",null,"Nothing much of what I can think of at the present point of time as there is nothing that I feel could be better at the moment.","I  think  cca is doing they can for the students","More flexible live lesson and tutoring hours.","Nothing","nothing at this time","You guys are doing a phenomenal job.","I would like better outreach from the middle school teachers.  This year I did not have really any outreach from my student's teachers.

Having been a \"community coordinator\" in the first two years of my oldest child's years with CCA, I have seen the field trip program go through a variety of changes.  Many I imagine were to satisfy STATE requirements, but also to keep from losing so much money because unfortunately some families just are not as responsible as we would like them to be when registering for trips where money is attached.  But to be limited to only one paid trip per month.......I have a bit of a concern about that and hopefully will have the opportunity to speak directly with Jill Fraser about them.  She is absolutely wonderful and willing to hear all parents.  Also, I think that there should be more regular contact between students and the guidance counselors starting with the middle school.   We know that this is a transition period for students across all levels, home, school, personal.  And since CCA does a wonderful job recognizing that you cannot separate the school experience completely from what is happening at home, I just think a connection with students and the counselors should be more routine.  Other than that.....I am hard pressed to state how CCA could do any better by me.","I'm satisfied with all the help that I recieved.","It has been wonderful to me and my son so far","It'll be great to have a prompt response from the technical support, especially in the beginning of the school year. We also hope that the consulars respond when we need them. Finally it will be very helpful if CCA have partnership with the Community College.","I believe the teachers are very helpful, which makes it easier for the child and learning coach.  They are quick to respond to any questions given.","Not sure. Some things are hard to follow but with a little trial and error you can pretty much figure things out. The class you go to doesn't really help when your child doesn't start til weeks later.","My son needs more socializing. And arts opportunities. We found that while teachers were welcoming, the other families in the philly catchment area to be unfriendly at field trips. I had thought because there as an office in Bryn mawr there'd be more real life activities organized for our area. The arts program seems to be for kids who are already professional not for exploration &amp; learning more. The isolation is hard. The workload is too much. Live lessons aren't optional like we were told teachers take off points for not attending LL","please call me at 7175929330 anytime and we can talk about this. Thanks.","All good!","I think they do a great job","CCA has been great.  Please note:  My decision not to re-enroll her has nothing to do with the quality of the education, etc.  My daughter's dream is to become a licensed cosmetologist and own her own hair and cosmetology salon so she will be enrolling in a tech school for her 11th and 12th grade years.  She must be enrolled in a participating brick and mortar school to get into the tech school, that's why she will not be returning next year.  Other than that, CCA has been great, just what she needed to help her focus after a volatile 9th grade year (which she had to repeat, unfortunately).","Right now, I have been having some issues with CCA. Hopefully they can solve these problems.","Make sure child takes ACT/SAT course in tenth grade","Improve quality of online assessments (fewer errors and poorly-worded or poorly-constructed questions.)","Nothing at all. I couldn't ask for anything, our tie at CCA has been everything and more.","i dont know","They could give more time for longer lessons","Continue doing what you are doing, its working.","For the most part you've been great so I thank you for that. We've had two laptop replacements...nobody told us during that time we could access school on other devices. I assumed it was an intranet like at past places I've worked.","I did have any problem","Nothing at this time, you're doing a great job already","The live lessons should be more apart in time.","Everything is going well so far.","Mix up the field trips\r\nScience bus pop up in Philadelphia\r\nA book fair would be cool in Philadelphia great way to get a lot of people to support the school\r\n","I am very satisfied with staff, teachers, and curriculum. Just keep up the great work!","It would be helpful to have the ability to select your live lesson schedule.  My child has a very strict training schedule and he enjoys live lessons, if we were able to select the times of those lessons he could have attended more throughout the year.","CCA is already doing an excellent job as far as I'm concerned.","I think they are doing a great job.","Don't have an answer at the moment.  I'm satisfied.","you can not serve me better. Teachers are not just exposing their lesson to the students but there is a follow up with emails, phone calls etc....better than live schools just to keep the students motivated ,counselors  are always here with their phone calls and they care about the feeling of the student and their families. Connection academy is the perfect school for my daughter.","Nothing","no sure","I would like to be informed if my child has missing assignments.","I am currently satisfied with CCA's services.","Keep up the excellent work.","I've answered this already.  More teachlets, more one-on-one onboarding from each teacher until child knows application.","everyone is great here, I don't have any complaints about any part of the curriculum, teachers, or administration.","I do not know of any additional ways CCA can better assist me.","My daughter and I need to know how to apply to scholarships.  She wants to work in the medical field and we would like help in deciding which trade schools or community college courses are available.","At this time, CCA is doing everything it possibly can. I am more concerned about federal legislation going on that might mess up cyber and homeschooling options. CCA's staff and teachers are responsive and go above and beyond the call of duty for their students, and they really care. The challenges we're dealing with, we'll find a way to work through. I think the Family Mentor program should be promoted a bit more.  I may look into tutoring options for what my child is struggling in, but that is in subject areas my child has trouble in, not due to problems with CCA. This is a challenge with special education, it can be more difficult for a child with learning differences to understand certain subjects, so I need to look into this.","I always get a responce when i ask about things.","Having separate literary magazines for K-8th and 9th-12th so mature content can be written by the older students, have more writing class choices, reinstating the writing club, making the pass/fail college/career class more relevant to prepared students (having them apply for scholarships as assignments, completing financial aid forms as assignments).  My daughter felt extremely censored by the lit magazine because of the age of the audience.  As high schoolers they should be able to write on mature age appropriate subjects.  My daughter had no real choices available for writing classes since none existed.  She would have enjoyed a novel writing, publication process class, itunes/ebook/amazon book publishing class.  Writing creatively as a career does not seem to be encouraged which is why we have had to find outside classes/programs. \r\n","I am already being served well.","I would like to see more preparation for the Keystone Exams","I have zero complaints about CCA","The service is fine as is.","There has been many offers in helping through your teachers that my child had or had but it my child, not having a better attitude.

The teachers do a great job communicating and really seem to care. We appreciate the updates that Dr. Flurie gives us. He seems like a real nice person who cares about the families and especially the students at CCA. We also like the new name of the school very much. Thank you Dr. Flurie, Staff and teachers at CCA for allowing my daughter Ashley to attend your school. She is very happy.","It would be nice if we have Science book for next year. Overall, it is much better to learn the material from book.","CCA can better serve me by providing transportation to the field trips if I don't have a way to get there?! And or maybe a ride share type thing.","By continuing to strive for excellence as Dr Flurie wants everyone at CCA to do.","I am quite satisfied at the moment.","The only problem I have is that when my son is lagging behind, I would like for that subject teacher to call the student and follow up with an email about the conversation with the student as well as the caregiver. I think the teacher has more weight as far as keeping on track and reviewing any problems with that subject.","Already doing everything possible","At the present CCA is doing an excellent job.","Keep up the good work.","I am satisfied with the service","You have done great job!","CONTINUE TO KEEP UP WITH NEW TECHNOLOGY","I didn't have any problems with how things operated.","Can't think of anything at the moment.","CCA has done a fine enough job","I dislike the excessive number of portfolios.

Please don't change nothing that is not broken. I can deal with the name change but everything else I would love to remain the same. It's amazing!","I think it should be less extra work. For my child who is a slow learner for her to grasp a lesson it takes time but by the time she is done all the other subjects shes forgot the first lesson.

My student felt he had been given the option for better opportunities for his future through enrollment at CCA. Once my student graduates he has plans to continue his education and eventually start a career in law enforcement. The curriculum is excellent and the teachers really care about the education of their students.  The administration/representatives are available for questions/comments, are very patient, and include parents in the decision-making process for the learning plans/courses assigned.","less emails very overwhelming","CCA could better serve the AP students by finding a way to accommodate for testing. It is not the easiest task to deal with the College board in reference to locating schools to take the test. Philadelphia Public school options were the worst as many had no idea who their AP coordinator was (or they were no longer there).  Some charter schools offering the exam had questions about why they should do it considering that they student does not attend there. It would also be helpful if the counselors and/or AP teacher (or another CCA staff member) took over this process. We were lucky enough to get a charter school to agree to let our daughter take the exam there however the process took several days and over 6 hours to get results. I almost felt like my child took an AP course did very well and now won't have the opportunity to take the exam. We were actually going to give up. Thankfully we already know of a school that would be willing to let her take the test there next year for the course she will be taking in 2016/2017. It would also be nice if CCA would consider if not a prom for high school students then some sort of spring formal to cover high school students. There are plenty of events schedule throughout the year I am not sure as to why this could not be considered an option. Many other cyber schools have them. Many students leave just for that experience. Some students reach out to try and attend at their local schools but it is not possible unless they attend with a current student. Yes students can play sports at other schools as per state law and CCA has plenty of clubs and field trips. However you guys definitely missed the ball on this one as there is not another option for students. Why not present a survey to gauge interest before the idea is cast aside? All and all we love CCA and will continue to recommend it to others without a doubt. We could not have been happier with our choice to remain apart of the CCA family.","An increase in the internet payment and to change the payment distribution time period. It's advertised that CCA will pay for internet service or it was advertise when my children were first enrolled. My daughter's computer has to stay plugged in at all times or it shuts off.

It is a total waste of time and only confuses the children.  I prefer the Calvert Curriculum to the Pearson Curriculum. \r\n\r\nI would like the school much better if there was not an excessive workload and the curriculum was not Common Core based.","I think there should be a 8 hour hand-on learning class for the new families, so we can get more familiar with the program. I think the program and the curriculum and the maneuvering in and out of the different areas are very confusing. New families need to know where to find the answers to the workbook questions. The books that the Caregivers get to assist the elementary school children doesn't even match the information in the computer. The assignments need to be more clear the Rubric versus the computer versus the book is too confusing the information doesn't coincide. I think to school should provide all the materials the student needs to complete the science experiments.","I would like to see my child evaluated at all levels because I want to be sure that learning disabilities are ruled out.","why bother to ask ?\r\nmy suggestions will not be implemented or heard or respected","More interactive learning.

We used to do more field trips, but now that they seem to be broken down to more specific grades, it's harder to get there as a family.\r\n4.I feel the 8th grade should be recognized for their hard work.  I understand that they can't do a full graduation ceremony, but I think it would be wonderful if CCA could maybe just mail out a \"diploma\" and maybe send a video message from the 8th grade staff.\r\n5.Also I would LOVE a search feature in the webmail.","No they are excellent","Everthing is great.","I can't think of anything because you seem to cover everything already.","Make the portfolios that the students have to do a lot easier for the students to do them and give them more time to complete the portfolio.  Some subjects give a 2 or 3 day time period to complete a portfolio, but sometimes it takes longer to do them.  Any portfolio that is a research paper should not have to be 3-4 pages on a topic such as an author and a story that a student had to do another portfolio on, because there is no way to get 3-4 pages on some topics.  I think research portfolios should be on a topic that the student might be interested in and then the student will probably get 3-4 pages or more.","me (the student) actually sits down and does school work and I also want to learn more on CCA","I can't think of anything that you are not doing already.","With not making it so difficult for the kids overall to go up.

CCA has been great.","I am satisfied with the program at this time.","CCA can better serve me by having an on site location to help when me and my child fall behind in work and we can go there to get help to get back on track","There should be different Live Lesson schedules for people with multiple children in different grades, so that all can attend at different times.  A parent should have other options when it comes to a grade that you don't agree with.  There should be someone else, who is objective, to come in and have an objective opinion concerning the issue.  Some of the problems on tests are very unfair and not grade appropriate and when an issue comes up, those questions should be addressed immediately.  Some of the teachers let the children in the chat pod control the class.  It's unfortunate that you have to sit and wait until the teacher chastises the student several times and finally puts the child out of the Live Lesson.  That's like the children having to suffer and not learn anything because someone is interrupting in a brick-and-mortar class.  There's no different.  The I-Ready test does not work correctly and needs to be scraped.  The teachers don't even give you the scores from the I-Ready tests, so what's the point?  My child was physically sick from taking the test.  My child had the same questions as their sibling who was 3 grades higher.  That is definitely a problem.  There are entirely too many portfolios and tests.  There is more to learning than spending days on a portfolio.","Please don't relax your standards or expectations of the students and families. The greatest benefit to our family is that my child has a challenging curriculum that keeps her college ready, in that she has real classwork she is responsible for everyday. She has learned so, so much about herself and the world around her. All three of my children have benefited from CCA. Your program has never given me a reason to think about other educational options. Every year I know my students will grow and be prepared to go on to higher learning if they choose. Thank you! I appreciate that you added profile pictures to staff communications; I would encourage CCA to keep finding ways to make CCA an institution that recognizes young students need to nurture their social skills with their peers and teachers.

Sometimes it takes a while to complete a portfolio, and usually there are several at the same time for different subjects. Students can become behind in their work because of this. One other thing is, I know students would attend more live lessons if teaches sent out a quick reminder every day there is a lesson. Although they have calendars, students read emails more often than look at their calendar. Some teachers already do this. It really helps.","talk to me and my child more often.","Na","so far doing fine","nothing right now","No complaints.

The issue is getting my student more motivated to achieve but what CCA has to offer is great.","I was happy that I got the chance to meet my daughter's homeroom/math in person.

What kind of professional development is available to teachers here? Is my daughter on grade level and on track to be ready for college and for a career? How do I know? How will my daughter teacher and I learn how to use the results from the state and district test to help my child make better progress?","not sure\r\n","I would like to see CCA start having some sports or physical activity team or clubs. where students can complete against each other from all around the state.","N/A","The only two weaknesses in the program are with the technical support and with guidance. I know that this has been a year of adjustment, but initially there was a noticeable difference in the quality of Tech Support. However, that has improved as the school year has progressed. The laptops and headsets still break too often, but because they are promptly replaced, this is only a small nuisance. Regarding guidance, I wish that there was more guidance for our juniors and seniors regarding college and scholarship applications. Other schools direct students towards specific scholarships and hold their hand a lot more through the college application process (SAT/ACT registration, college admissions applications, and scholarship applications). I wish that there was more of that. The guidance counselors are helpful when I reach out to them, but, other than the College Planning or Career Planning courses, there doesn't seem to be a program in place that really addresses the needs of seniors. I think additional support is necessary. I would also LOVE it if CCA would partner with local community colleges throughout the state so that students could participate in a dual enrollment program and get some college credits under their belts while still getting high school credits. I have a few students for whom I am the learning coach who have expressed an interest in attending community college while still attending CCA.","I wish that there were less portfolios in the lessons. I also hope in the future that CCA creates a blended environment where students can be taught in a real class on certain days.","This past year the homeroom teacher has been wonderful with reaching out to me with any concerns I may have had. My daughter spent some time in the hospital and the teachers could not have been more helpful than they were when she got out.  I feel that the teachers she had this year have served us well.","Everything is fine.","The only thing I would like to change is the quizzes should be more questions.","Making the field trips once again open and available for all students, regardless of years attending or ability to pay. The field trips and interacting with the other students was the best part of CCA. The students no longer feel a connections with real people/friends anymore!! This is the major reason why we are considering other options down the road if the current systems stays in place. Not only do the students need the interaction with others students who are doing the same thing, the parents need the social interaction with other parents who know the unique challenges this type of schooling involves.","Its fine how it is","Just keep up with your great work","It's great now","You can better serve my daughter if you have smaller classes and the teacher have a small amount of children to take care of. It is very hard to communicate with teachers who have more than 36 kids to their classroom.","I'm hoping there will be more social interactions among students and also with teachers, even virtually.","Not sure.","They are great 100%","CCA need to cut down on trips restrictions. Family should be able to attend any trip if they are willing to paid for it because for some of us the trips are the only place the kids get to interact with students their own age.","CCA is doing a great job! Probably some more in person sessions with administrators and teachers would be nice.  Especially since my child lives in Philadelphia and her teacher is in Harrisburg.","More flexibilities in attending classes and options classes, especially languages like French and Geman etc.","The teachers are amazing, Mrs. Rieger and Mrs. Seymore are the best teachers EVER!

The wording in the lesson says \"your student\".  Why?  My older students are reading the lesson on their own sometimes so the language like it is speaking to a teacher instead of the student does not make sense.","I can't think of anything except replacement of older laptop that has issues.","n/a","1) Do not allow students to delete webmails without learning coach's knowledge.  My daughter calls herself dating.  She deletes the webmails so I do not see them.  I log in as her to see the conversation.  2)  Allow learning coach to determine if assessment feedback can be given at any time of the day or later in the day.  If my son receives a bad grade in the middle of the school day, it sometimes through him off track for the rest of the day.  I would prefer that he would see his grade like after 3 pm.   3)  Cyber school might give some kids the impression that everyone behind the screen is friendly.    Include online safety training with counselors.   Cyber school makes kids too comfortable with the computer and making friends online.  I do not want any students to treat other places like they would CCA believing that all online spaces are safe.","None sure, happy with the service.","Some times it's a little hard to find things on the website.","Beginning of the year info/in person workshop/sessions information available online through text/slides/video.","You have been the best.","Continue to do what your doing.

Now that our advocate and I have expressed these concerns and called quarterly IEP/progress meetings, communication has been better. I do appreciate the weekly calls that our learning support teacher has with us. I wish CCA had a better understanding of the unpaid aide work that special ed learning coaches do on a daily basis. Our \"job descriptions\" go beyond the typical LC responsibilities that CCA advertises. Often times we are previewing and chunking lessons, reading lessons aloud, prompting our children throughout their schedule as well as their assignments, checking their understanding, providing behavior and OT support, looking for ways to improve on their deficits, etc. If CCA acknowledged all that its special ed families are doing, the teachers and administrators might have trainings or support hours to coach us on how to help our differently wired children academically. Some school districts provide special ed family support groups and trainings once they recognize the need for additional support. In the meantime, the special ed group on Facebook is helping somewhat with this need for community and support.","If there were Spanish translators that would be awesome.","I've been pleased with the services provided, overall.","I am completely satisfied with my time at CCA that is why my child will be reenrolling.","i am extremely satisfied with cca","I honestly don't have an answer.  I think you guys are on top of everything and when we have had issues in the past it was resolved.  People listen to me and help with the situation.

I feel like I am always heard when I do have an issue.  Keep up the great work.","Na","Special education educators and administrators need to be current with PA law and IEP policies.  We have also experienced unprofessional behavior with a former special education facilitator, both to the parent as well as witnessed the behavior directed at therapists.","I'd love to see more hands learning in my child's area of interest. She has a passion for makeup application, helping/ mentoring young children, golfing, cheerleading and dance. Maybe there are more that I haven't located on the site.......","no answer","Reach out to student about transition to college.","CCA is doing great, my children are doing great at school. Excellent teachers!","You have some great teachers and not so great teachers.  I don't know if it is because they have such a large volume of students, but especially this year I have been particularly disappointed with the communication I have had with teachers.  I feel like they do not seek to reach out to students.  I feel like they really don't care about a person's grade.  For instance, my daughter reached out to her Spanish teacher several times during the first semester to try and get extra credit.  The teacher responded with there is no extra credit just redo your portfolio.  The teacher never highlighted the value of the portfolio, never reached out to ask her where she is struggling, or how she could be of assistance?  Mrs. Beuno never went over the fact that there is only one portfolio and it is worth 100%  While the percents are listed, my daughter never experienced this kind of % total.  Most classes it has more of 33% and in the midst of her full schedule and sickness did try to put forth effort, but was also seeking to complete out her semester.  I just feel like the teachers are very impersonal.  While my daughter had a B in the class, obviously by her several attempts to reach out to her teacher, it just seemed like a minimal response with really low effort on the teacher's part.  It would have been extremely helpful if the teacher indicated to the class, hey this portfolio is 100% worth your grade so put a lot of time and effort into this project because it has a lot of pull on your grade level, even more so than the mid term grade.  My daughter studied hard for the mid term, got an A, but it really didn't matter because she missed the emphasis on the portfolio in large part because her teacher really was passive.  I find this to be true of most of the teachers and their interaction with my student.  I am extremely disappointed, dissatisfied and will most likely NOT return.  I have shared this opinion with others because I would like to see greater ownership of the students from the teachers.  I would like to have seen Mrs. Bueno when getting several emails from my daughter to have called my daughter and ask her why she is worried about her grade, how can she help her to get from good to excellent?  My daughter cares and I would like to see the teachers of this program raise the bar for the way that see their students and relate to them.  I reached out to the teachers and was not impressed:(","There seemed to be a lot of change in teachers this year with a couple of my kids.  It got to the point where 2 of my kids did not know who was their math teacher.  Each teacher taught differently and with each change of teacher there was an adjustment period to figure out how the new teacher ran things.  This was very frustrating for both children.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if the middle school science had a book they could follow along with more easily.","Being more clear on materials needed for each week/months science projects etc. Better reading materials that teach them to love classical literature. Spacing of portfolios.","I would love to see the curriculum to be more flexible, more personal and creative. I think that it is excellent that CCA is moving away from the \"Box\" curriculum.  I would love to see the ability for our HS students to attend tech programs along with CCA.  I also think having more portfolio work, community service and real world activities associated with the curriculum would be helpful.  My oldest now in college attended a charter school in RI when we lived there called the Met .. http://www.themethighschool.org/   it was an excellent real world experience for him.  \r\nWe are very happy with CCA and look forward to the separation from Connections Academy.","CCA is doing a great job already.","Overall, we are satisfied with CCA, however there are a few things that were bothersome this year. Sunday is our family day, as I am sure it is for most families. It is the only day we do not have school or work. We frequently get communications from CCA on Sundays. Since everyone gets email on their phone now, it is disturbing to get those school related emails on Sunday. It always interrupts family dinner or something fun we are trying to do together and puts a damper on things. Personally, I do not think there should be any CCA communications on the weekends unless it is an emergency. Also, I understand the need for the use of filters to monitor the integrity of the students work, but twice this year my daughter was accused of cheating when she actually did no such thing. She sits with a parent or learning coach at all times and there is no way it happened. Both time she was very upset and wanted to leave CCA. She felt the teachers were accusing her of lying and cheating, which she really took to heart. Perhaps the teachers should be a little more sure about these accusations before communicating to the student. I know these are 2 things that may not seem to be major concerns, but they are enough to change the way we feel about the program.","We are extremely pleased with how CCA serves us currently and cant think of anything that would need to be better.","Please, Please, Please! Do not schedule the portfolios all at once from each subject, this makes the curriculum overwhelming and exasperating for the students and the parents especially when they have more than one student enrolled. The portfolios are not hard, there are just too many too complete at one time. There is also not enough time given to complete these portfolios.","not sure","nothing","respond more quickly to emails","By continuing working with the parent/learning coaches and keeping the communication lines open.","You all have been doing a great job I really appreciate all the help you've been giving my son and my family I think this is going to be a long-term relationship thank you very much.","For children who need modifications, like my son, make these options easier to find and use. My son often forgets to use them, mainly because he does not see them. He regularly completes work that is too difficult for him and his grades reflect this.","more mandatory due dates for tests in the main subjects (and pop up reminders of those due dates) My son gets overdue because puts off taking test.  An app on his phone allows him to set up things to do for the day and insert the times that he is to do them.  at those times a notification pops up and tells him 'you should now be working on ...' and that has been very helpful.  something like that might be helpful for younger kids (middle school age) if it was thru connexus.","na","Like I had said everyone has been amazing and more than helpful. I would never give a bad review because of one person. I think everything is perfect. Thank you","It would be great to have a few more elective options at the high school level.","They do a great job, I think next year we will be more involved in extracurriculars.","This has been a great experience and we are greatful to have had options for our struggling student.","Keep up the good work!","No complaints","Nothing comes to mind at this moment.","It would be nice if there was an 8th grade graduation, like at every school in our area so that my child and the children of CCA could experience that closure and end of such a huge milestone. It would be helpful to provide us with materials, videos, documents and materials to help friends and family understand this schooling. Car magnets, tshirts, sweatshirts - we would love to display our pride for our school but there is no where to purchase or do these things!","I really think it would be helpful if CCA had more live lessons for elementary students. Two live lessons a day seems subpar compared to the amazing schedule that the middle school has. There is a lot of critical learning that happens in elementary and too much of it relies on a learning coach. I am not a teacher, and Science, and Social Studies are all in my hands. It is too much to do without a live lesson for these subjects. It also feels like when middle school comes for my current 4th grader she will be overwhelmed with going from two to MANY live lessons. There needs to be a transition here. \r\nI wish CCA would talk up their high school and promote it to current 7th and 8th graders instead of leaving parents in the dark about what to expect, forcing us to find the answers on Facebook message boards. Many families in brick and mortar are ushered into high school in a much more welcoming, open manner, and it is just not the case here. CCA has the curriculum to back it up, I think if you focused on your 7th and 8th grade students and parents and talked about staying through to highschool and what your high school has to offer, it would not only be appreciated, it would be beneficial to you as well.\r\nIt saddens me that there is no stepping up ceremony for 8th grade students. 8th grade is a big deal, and there is NOTHING done at CCA to congratulate them, honor them or get them excited for high school. There should be as every brick and mortar in the area does this for their 8th graders. \r\nThese are issues that MANY parents feel. We will be continuing at CCA but I do wish that existing families were ushered through the changes, such as elementary into middle school, middle school into high school a bit better. There is a lack of human contact here and this is the only time when it feels like we are NOT in a \"real\" school. If these issues were addressed, I feel as though CCA would thrive. Thanks for your time!","The new class schedule was more difficult than helpful.  My son did better with a set schedule and not so many options.","I think there should be better instruction on portfolios on the message board. Language Art class don't have any instructions on the message board. I've been in and out o f the hospital this year so my daughter has fallen behind at times. I think all classes should have instructions on the message board because student may do homework in the evening do to family situation.","Get the special ed part some decent staff.  My LST has called us once in two months.  I had to ask for a month for a norep for the new IEP, but in the end it didn't matter.  NONE of the changes have been implemented since December. I have called, emailed,  begged for help.  Now I am forced to start due process.  I do not believe it's because no one cares.  But you can't ask LST's to facilitate the IEP's, sit in all those meetings, AND work with the skills with the kids.  There isn't enough staff.  Your curriculum has nothing in place to serve kids with ADHD, yet how many kids would benefit from having lessons modified for them?  The special ed department could stop putting out fires and actually start helping the kids.  Have been fighting for help for my kid for three years now, and I am no further along from when I started.  Three. Years.","You don't serve your families anymore. Field trips no longer work with kids in multiple grades. new teachers are forcing things like skills tutors for straight A students or assigning permanent 0's without warning when formerly, we'd have a couple of weeks, your special department should be sued for their blatant disregard of the law.  You got overwhelmed by your size and don't appear to be fixing it, just advertising for more students.  It's a slap in the face.  I withdrew two last fall, and my last child this week.  Done.  IT's a shame because when we first enrolled 4 years ago, CCA was top notch.  Now it's just a brick/mortar school online.... kids are a number, not real people.","Keep providing great teachers and curriculum!","Common core needs to go.  This curriculum is terrible but I do love the fact that CCA teachers can help learning coaches and students navigate around the common core curriculum failings.  Also the class trip policy needs to accommodate the fact that families have more than one student enrolled and has to choose between their children when going on a paid trip.  I was also disappointed in how the replacement of my 4th graders teacher was handled.  Serious lack of communication on the administration's part.","Need better ways to manage my children's access to webmail.","CCA has served me well!","Can't think of anything at the moment.  Unless you want to send an actual teacher here to teach her one on one :D","CCA did fairly well this year. I think what was offered was good.","Just keep up the existing great service.  Thanks.","i guess just call ppl back and we are still getting used to it..\r\n","I think CCA was a good fit for my daughter and all of the teachers were so supportive of her committment to ballet training.  My only qualm was with the graduation project.  From my understanding, the graduation requirement is mandated by PA.  My daughter successfully completed her graduation project in 10th grade at North Penn.  She completed it early so that she didn't have to worry about it later.  However, when she switched to cca her graduation project no longer counted and now she was required to complete a 2nd graduation project.","N/A","I don't have any suggestions.\r\n","Perhaps a few more classes devoted to the medical/healthcare field.","So far everything is ok","No suggestions at this time.","I don't have any suggestions.","More synch classes for younger children.","Let semester b open early for the kids that can handle it. My kids were done with semester A 3 weeks early. I knew we were going away in February  , so it would have been nice to get ahead in semester b. Also I do not believe in busy work so opening semester B up early would have been great! At the end of school year for those done early create a club to do experiments. I took my kids on many self created fieldtrips to the zoo and ect...","I would love to have live lessons five days a week again. It really helps with having multiple kids.","It would be great if the student planner be more flexible, so I can move and schedule the day for my child right on the planner calendar.","Unsure - I'm happy.","I wished my son could have more friends, so maybe a place where high school students could meet up a couple days a week to do lessons.  The field trips are nice but not enough students my son's age attend.","Get rid of he assessment emails, I have 3 children so it clogs up my email it sometimes hinders me from getting to the urgent emails. I see the feedbacks in the grade book the emails are to too much. Also, I struggle with the \"I can do it myself' child, and then when faced with failure is ashamed to ask for help. Another issue is Guidance for seniors that are failing that are not their teachers that could call with encouraging words would be nice, when they get a call from their teacher they are not thinking help their thinking this is my teacher, I spoke to guidance once this year to change a class for my daughter at the beginning of the school year and come the find out the teacher had no record of her and it was pain and my daughter never spoke up until it was to late. It has its plusses and its minuses but so much better than going to a school that determines what they will and will not do for you because of who you are. CCA has opened doors no matter your struggles. thank you.","idk","They already help me.","Great teachers, great curriculum, great school.!","My daughter wants to go to Vo-Tech and was hoping she could go thru CCA","Unsure.","It would be nice if CCA had one on one tutoring especially with math.","explain the process on experiments and portfolios better","By remaining the Best online school, and continue to help future students as you have done so, with my daughter.","They do a great job.","all is good. No changes.","nothing I can think of","More timely communication between teachers and parents.","There are certain courses and materials in the course that I feel are too much for some of my students.  I wish I had the option for those non core courses to choose what to do within them.  I.E. Ed. Tech, Art, etc","Provide structure and consistency for special ed kids. My son's English teacher refuses to provide structure because according to her that's just not how she teaches. Teachers are constantly out for other projects so there's either no class or class with a teacher my son doesn't know. This sets off my aspergers son and apparently there is no alternative for him. This makes our home life hell at times and the teachers hands are tied. There needs to be more consideration for special needs kids.","The new High School Live Lesson offerings are not the best for some families ours included.  My students prefer daily LL's that follow the course planner that are offered by the same teachers at the same time on a schedule.  My high schooler gave up trying to keep track of when LL's were being offered, what they were covering, etc.  He simply watched the recordings as he needs too and works with the individual teachers.  Another big let down this year, was finding out that there was no printable course catalog available.  We can only access it online.  It is very hard to help my student pick courses for next year when we can not have it readily available in our hands and have to keep flipping between screens on the computer.  We used to mark pages, highlight, etc....we do not have that option this year.  In 11 years of being here, I would have to say that this was probably the most disappointing.","By fully developing your own curriculum and stopping the ridiculous payments to Connections Education. You waste precious taxpayer dollars! Fix it now!!","improve some of the curriculum- art is really not appropriate- some of the science curriculum treats the children like college students who need to read the book and understand- had it not been for the teacher and the gifted program my daughter would have lost interest in the science curriculum-","Curriculum for some of the subjects needs to be reviewed and adjusted. The arts curriculum is too advanced and sometimes not even appropriate for a 4th grader.","Opt out of PSSA testing. Waste of educational time. I believe CCA has more tests in an average year to show what my children know.","Thank you for the past 4 years.  CCA has been a great option for us.  We appreciated Dr. Flurie's video updates-short, informative and relational!","n/a","No PSSA testing!!!!   No Keystones!!!","CCA could serve us better by having all staff follow though on what they say they will do and not leave us guessing last minute if medical accomodations will be followed.","better response from teachers on some subject","N/A","stay flexible","do not know","it was great","Not sure","A lot of assignments (HS) tend to be unnecessary and over-kill (English assignments).  The foreign language is very good, except they tend to spend too much time on the culture, etc. than the basics of vocabulary, grammar and speaking it (Time to Talk is very good, should probably be longer or more frequent).  Study Island assignments should only be given when extra help is needed (more busy work).  Career planning also tends to give too many assignments.  I agree the children should think about it, but the detail involved in crazy; most kids (and adults) don't know what they will actually like or want to do for  a living.","I would be nice if the teachers could teach along with the course work. It is hard for a student to spend an hour on a live lesson and then have another hour or two that they need to spend doing the actual course.  Do you really want them to be in school from morning to bedtime.  One year that is what my student was faced with.  Teachers should have a timeline to grade work.  We still had work that had to be graded right before the progress reports were printed and therefore you never got to read the feedback since it was past the marking period.  In Language Arts we are telling our kids to read books like From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler, where they talk about drugs, sucide and kids running away from their parents or how about a Wrinkle In Time where they talk about mediums, evil beings, or confront Christian ideology or what about A Walk With Two Moons when the characters talk about sex and talk about kissing a tree pretending it's their girlfriend/boyfriend. What happened to the classic books? The curriculum needs to be looked at again. In science a lot of the lab do not work out.  But when you complained about it 3.5 years ago with your first student and it comes around again for your next student you know nobody is listening. My biggest complaint is that as a parent I am always doing school.  I feel like I have no life.  Either in the day I am helping kids with schoolwork or at night grading their papers. There is no rest on weekends either when the kids are making up for anything they did not complete throughout the week. At times I feel like the course and verbiage is too difficult. For example the way the Arts lesson's instruct Kindergarten, etc. kids.  They don't understand it because they have not seen those words.  I wish also that we were allowed a few scheduled field trips throughout the year.  One year a teacher told me she would only approve 4 hours for the field trip, although it took me 1 hour and 20 minutes to get there and come back. Then after that we still had to rush home and do school when we got back. My child was working until bedtime. Also, a long weekend for Spring Break is too short.  You can't even go that far for such a short weekend.  Needless to say that most spring breaks we have to spend doing school work. I also wish that some of the subjects used books like 6th grade science. The fact of the matter is that if this curriculum wasn't free I would probably have picked another one a long time ago because there is no balance between life and school, since we always seem to be doing school and even when there is down time we are working on PE which is the same as doing school.","No comment at this time, we are extremely happy with CCA.","At this time my biggest problem with CCA remains with the Special Education Department.  Official deadlines are rarely met, services are delayed being set up, and communication is often lacking.  Improvement of this department on all grade levels would make CCA much better, quite possibly the best Cyber School in Pennsylvania.  The Cyber School model in Special Education could vigorously meet the needs of students, especially in the lower grades and there is a good chance that many students could progress to minimal to no IEP accommodations.  Happy parents, lower costs, and an excellent selling tool.","Revamp your curriculum.  You have a lot of forms provided in the lessons that are not useable. There are lots of errors and contradictions in the curriculum and also the answer key has incorrect answers at times which is difficult for the learning coach.  Each teacher has there own way of doing things.  Some teachers do not go by the rubric in the lesson, but have their own rubric.  If you do not attend the live lesson, since they are optional, then you do not know what is going on and you will get points off. Points are taken off on assignment even though they are not on the rubric. Some lessons are too long.","Let the student know when they are not doing something right","Na","Continued support for Learning coaches.  Advice, encouragement, helpful tips...in small bits.  Not another long lesson for us to watch.   It's hard, especial with multiple young kids enrolled.  I'm hoping to be able to request teachers.  That's been a tough one.  Having a teacher who takes the time to connect and get to know the student is important.  Not all teachers are great at that.  I need someone else who will help me if I see a struggle or problem.  If they only talk to my student for 30 seconds a call and cancel most Live Lessons, that won't happen.","We are fine so far.","The teachers need to be a bit better informed about allowing kids to move ahead. We had no issues with my daughter (now in 6th) moving at her own pace when she was in K-2 but with my son for math we were told nothing could be done (policies had changed) until I heard through the FB group that I should talk with the principal. Once we did that we were able to have my son move forward. His teacher was not aware we could do this (or did not want this done) thought she has been very supportive otherwise.",null,"In our case CCA was exactly what we needed to get our daughter through High School. We started in 10th grade and our experience was very positive. I did partner with a tutor to aid me as my daughter's learning coach, which was not required. We were quite pleased with the curriculum and the fact that she was accepted into 3 universities (the honors program in 1) is a testament to its strength.","The teachers haven't quite been as responsive the past 2 years as they have been in other years. It has been hard to get a hold of teachers and have them return phone calls/webmails.","N/A","Teachers need to not penalize students for not attending Live Lessons when they are carrying a straight A average. Teachers need to have a set time to grade items, there have been multiple times this year and last that my students have waiting over 3 to 4 weeks for a quiz, test, or portfolio to be graded, this has held them back on moving forward in a positive way. If teachers are not holding and recording and posting their Live Lessons on a regular basis, they need to be penalized. Again, this has effected my students in a HUGE way!","really very satisfied","At this time, CCA has met all our needs!  Thank you to all the staff for their dedication and willingness to help the students succeed in life.  THANK YOU!","n/a","More understanding when it comes to child missing school because of doctor appointments.  The learning support teacher needs to help and pay more attention, it seems he really does not care.  The one my child had last year was wonderful, you can tell she cared and really tried to help my child, the one my child has this year is severely lacking.","Continue to train teachers to be active and listening supportive team players.  Andrea Azzalina and Ann Breithaupt are excellent examples of what teachers should exemplify. Unfortunately, we have experienced less than stellar quality in the past.","Not sure","Find your exemplary teacher in each grade and have them train their grade colleagues.\r\nBring back Hershey trip - even if it means cutting out others throughout the year. It really helped Cca feel closer when we did that","Would love to see more grade specific gatherings at the school centers. It would not involve a cost of a field trip, just the chance for the kids to maybe work on a portfolio or discuss what is going on in their classes, etc.","We enrolled toward the end of the school year- at the cut off point to be exact. This made navigating the site much more challenging- almost to the point of frustration. More detailed information on how to navigate lessons would have been helpful. I would have taken a class. It makes me sad my child can't join a club until after 30 days of enrollment.","One thing I have noticed on Field trips or at the centers - the teachers do not interact to much with the students face to face. One in the center, they did not seem to have control of the students. Would also love to see the science teachers have \"hands on\" labs in the centers and for those who cannot attend to see them over live lesson.","I don't have any complaints.","More direction as to how to access material with lessons for enrolled student.  When I tried to access learning material it says access denied, use courseconnect and not able to find this material in order to help my student.","previously mentioned these","We enrolled in the middle of the year which made it a little difficult to get caught up but the teachers have all been patient and supportive to us and our son. The orientation evening was informative and helpful.","Everything is fine at this point.","We just feel that our son is doing whatever, we have no input, and the teachers don't call the student until the last week of school. Having the students do their projects at the end of the semester with no penalty is crazy, that's not the real world.","I think you are doing a great job. I wish you offered a magic pill that would motivate my teens some days. :-)  I really like that you have classes for learning coaches as I have learned some helpful tips from them. Unfortunately I can never attend the live lesson because I work but I am glad for the recordings.","We did enjoy the Hersheypark experience.  We wish that could be brought back.","We would prefer live lessons every day if possible, but understand if the teachers need this time for activity days because we also enjoy attending these special events as well.",null,"I think we are already served well! I can't think of anything that would be better.","I believe a schedule should be put out on a monthly (or other type) basis where teachers let parents know when they'd like to call. My work schedule is rather crazy and 9 times out of 10 I miss the calls because I'm working.","Provide more field trips and social events closer to my location.","The equipment had a lot of technical issues.","Unsure.","We generally have had awesome teachers.  We have a Physical Science teacher this year in the High School who doesn't answer my son's emails, ignores class questions (even when there are only 3 students present), and is not keeping up on grading within a realistic time frame.  He even stopped recording during a class to tell the students that he's going through a really tough divorce!!!  These really sub par teachers need to be removed.  There are so few of them, which I'm very thankful for, but they do hurt the school and the students.","Nothing as of now","Just hold your teacher's to a reasonable reason/grading schedule for assignments.  Even AP students need timely feedback to improve and prepare for their AP Exam.","unknown you are doing so well I have no needs for better service.","I think CCA's program is great the way it is.

More Art/PE teachers for Middle School.  The amount of students in each live lesson doesn't allow children to participate, causes major chaos on the chat pod, and sometimes causes issues with entering a live lesson...too many kids to just one teacher....not as effective as it could be.  Leap Tests and Benchmarks should be alternated, or NOT overlapped like they are.  Educational Technology Course is very repetitive year after year.","We are very happy.","If the program was more flexible, reliable server connections that didn't mess with our home internet, and better written curriculum in various subjects.","The curriculum is AWFUL!  It drives me batty that my children study the book, study guides, &amp; past lessons and the knowledge that they have on the unit they've studied is not tested upon, in many Unit Tests.  Instead they are instructed to read long stories and answer 5 questions about the story they have never heard before.   I will NEVER understand why 3 Science Books are provided to Middle School Students EVERY YEAR but NEVER referenced and do not go along properly with the online lessons.  And those LA \"What/Why do you think...\" questions on the test make me really angry, as I don't think any answer should be marked off incorrectly when you are asking a student what they think, but I do feel that the student should have a chance to explain why they think their choice is the correct one; and then be graded on that portion of their answer.  Once again, I am holding on hope that the curriculum for CCA will improve this upcoming year.","you guys were good.  My child won't be returning next year.","I cannot think of anything.","This is our fourth year with CCA, and we are very satisfied.  The few suggestions we have are as follows:  1) eliminate the non-contact approaching alarm and alarm for students with straight A grades, or consider replacing it with an optional Webmail contact, 2) get away from the federally-controlled Common Core curriculum, and allow the creativity and vision of CCA's administrators and teachers to drive the curriculum, and 3) try to more carefully develop schedules and planners, so that multiple portfolios in different classes are not all due around the same time.","My concern with enrolling her for her 11th and 12th grade years are the lack of hands-on labs in the science courses.  We're also interested in dual enrollment which is not offered through CCA","Only down side is the labs in science classes.  Not as hands-on as I'd like especially in biology and chemistry.  I know there are AP classes but dual credit offerings would be helpful too.","better more understanding curriculum","Meet the teacher days ... re evaluate your field trip system . each kid should be able to pick a trip that the whole family can go on. not just 1  a month. bring back the Hershey trip","I would like to see a better option for families with multiple grade children close together be able to combine their Social Studies and Science classes, keeping LA and Math on each child's grade level.","Your doing well.","Unknown","My only concern with the science classes is that they are not as hands on as a brick and mortar school.  I realize it's hard with the geographic area that you cover and having a \"lab\" would be very hard.  That was our only disappointment with science.","I think Special Education could be more responsive to concerns and questions. I also feel like information for parents could be a little easier to retrieve.","My son has learning support classes and we are hoping it will return to the style of his 1st year at CCA where we could have the choice to attend the LL or do the recording other than being required to attend LL which tends to lessen the flexibility of cyber school. This was a nice option on his \"off days\".","My son moves up to 6th grade middle school and he is concerned his teachers will not be sweet and kind like Ms Kelsey McGovern has been these last 3 years. So making his transition into middle school a little smoother may help him and our family greatly. Thank you for all the hard work done by all the staff at CCA","There needs to be fewer modifications with the lessons.  My son prefers to work straight through.  Adding modifications and different places to turn in work creates confusion for him causing lower grades.","Provide more field trip opportunities in my area...As it stands, there are VERY few in Berks County.","i think it is a good school doesn't need to get better.","CCA is serving my family well.","At this point there is not a better way of serving our family. I have already decided that my daughter will attend a different Cyber school next year.","Some of the portfolios could use a example of what the finished product that the student is required to do looks like. Some of the portfolios written instructions are  in my opinion vague and confusing.","Have more activities in my area.  Ex: picture taking, parent programs, graduation ceremony\r\nMany activities take place in Harrisburg or Phila which both are at least a 2 hr drive and many activities are for half a day.  I would like to attend activities.\r\n\r\n","They have been very helpful. I'm not sure how else they can serve me better.","I'm satisfied with the service.","None","I would like to see teachers teach our children to take good notes. To show them how to take notes and not just tell them.","Just some observations . . . Sometimes the tests are really long and my student loses steam till the end. I'm not a fan of the timed tests, although I believe my student doesn't have any this year. Perhaps they're already gone. And the really big one . . . I would much prefer that once the student hits math that needs a graphing calculator, they are issued a school calculator like a TI-84 plus. I appreciate the ease of the online calculator, but the student cannot take that into the SAT or ACT tests. Plus if the students are issued a calculator, they all have the same one and the teacher can really help them become familiar with it and get the best use out of it.","We have been very pleased with CCA!","Better support/compatibility with Apple devices.","With having 4 children enrolled emails were difficult to separate as to what student it was for.","While still working as a school is doing, everything is fine. Children should always have the cameras running laptops for teachers to see children and correct any task. This way it's like my children in just one year they learned to read in English. The class is much more interesting and more serious.","No comments","I was unhappy with the fact most of the materials my children received were damaged.

It sat in the warehouse for two weeks before it was actually sent out on the truck.  I was sent a new laptop but it failed, so I sent it back and received an older one.  But the older pc had no webcam in it.  We used the older pc for about 2 months and decided to use the webcam for class.   But there was no webcam.  I had to call Tech support and they said that model had no webcam in it.  They should have sent a webcam with it in the first place.  But they did send a webcam for it after I called about it.  I have had no problems with the older pc.  That's really the only problems I ran into with the school.  Everything else is fine.","I may choose to have my daughter return another time at a later time.  I think the teachers are great but the curriculum seems to move really fast, especially in 3rd grade math. The amount of topics they covered is mind boggling and my daughter had a very hard time keeping up. We had to look for outside pages for her to do to help her with the concepts. I think it would be better to teach ideas a little slower and get them more secure before moving on. I don't like the fact that there are no science and social studies classes for the younger grades. Also, I feel the higher grades need to have more consistency.  They need a math and english class every day not once or twice a week. Also, there should never be an overlap of basic classes.  My son,  2 different years had to pick which class to attend because there was an overlap of basic math, english and science.","The adminastration could be alot more understanding of children with special needs!!!!!!","CCA can better serve parents with children in the Special Education Program with better communication.","Perhaps have more variety of classes to choose from.","unsure","There is a lack of communication within the structure of CCA.

We had this problem over spring break, where it wouldn't let him move on because with modified testing, we must wait until the teacher grades it. We did however go into the regular test and he answered one question, submitted it, clicked the check mark so the system knew he took the test and  had to send his teacher a webmail explaining why we had to do that.

I have found some teachers prefer to work outside the curriculum at the high school level.  I have had issues that were escalated to school principals with emails sent to my kids and were not satisfied as I was told they would be.

Unproven and DISproven information is in the books with regards to social studies and american history.","na","We had so many problems starting up this semester that my daughter started out almost 2 months behind. While the faculty is extremely helpful and caring, the staff are confused and not helpful.","Perhaps by making mid year transfers less discouraging by being so many lessons behind.  I'm not sure how that can be avoided though.","I hope that CCA can continue to offer flexibility to the students who chose a cyber school because of activities during the day. Some teachers are flexible and work with our schedule, others not so much. It is difficult if teachers' have due dates for assignments/portfolios that are completely inflexible. My daughter is very studious and conscientious but cannot participate in \"live\" lessons when they occur during the day. She is in a gymnastics camp in Texas every 6-8 weeks, with little internet connectivity, which makes it difficult to complete some assignments. When we had difficulty with a 9th grade English teacher, the principal was very responsive although the teacher was not when we contacted her.","Better field trip program and end of year field trip.","By offering more choices of high school electives.","Everything has been great.","Just keep on doing the things you are currently doing.

Limiting the ability of child to get socialization and additional experiences.","Just continue to help students that need help or tutoring.","I am quite satisfied with CCA's services.","My child is special needs and has a lot of therapy and drs. It would be nice to have all the Live Lessons in the morning so we could do her appointments in the afternoon and not miss the LL.","N/A","Just keep the communications between the teachers and students. Have teachers help when needed.","Go back to the way you ran the school the last 8 years. And let the families have the opportunity to go to more field trips by giving them so much per student per year and let them use it how they wish there are months when we are not interested in field trips and months when there is more than one. So it would be nice to use the money as we would like on the trips we would like.","More socialization in our community. That is really lacking in our area.","Everything is fine.","It would be helpful to have discounts in place in your area to have them participate in lessons-music,  art,  etc.  Also discounts to staples out office supply stores to help with the cost of school supplies.  Did our large family we struggle in that area. Thank you for your time.","I would like to see more field trips and the end of the year picnic to be brought back this is sometimes the only opportunity for the students to meet their teachers.","From my experience being new, I think teachers need to realize that we may not understand the program fully. My son received a 0 for participation in a Math skill set. We did not have it and also didn't understand that we had to do it or where to find it. We reached out to the teacher and she never responded back. After 3 weeks of not seeing anything on it, she gave my son the 0. She never communicated with us about it. We are new and I feel that she should have realized that and reached out to us. In short, new people need a little more follow-up communication.","I have no issuse","Open a branch office in the Easton/Bethlehem/Allentown area. There are a lot of families that would benefit from access to teachers and CCA event.   We have rent hotel rooms constantly.  I also think that more families would enroll at CCA if there was a presence in the Lehigh Valley area.  We need more social/ field trips in this area to build the sense of community and loyalty to CCA that we experienced 3 years ago.","I have spoke to families and staff and they agree that we need a branch office in the Lehigh Valley area. (Allentown, Bethlehem or Easton)  We have many families that can not travel an hour + to attend free events in Andreas. We also need more field trips so that we can form a sense of community and see friends more often.","I realize they have a large number of students however I feel that sometimes the teacher and guidance counselor do not respond back in a timely manner .","CCA is fantastic just the way it is!","I think that the Lehigh Valley (Allentown, Bethlehem, Easton area) needs a branch office and drop-in center.

He has his assignments done but there is no contact from the teachers on there part and he rather send an email and sometimes the teacher does not even respond.","CCA has done a lot for my child","not sure","Teachers miss so many days of live lessons, due to sickness, meetings, field trips, etc., when student is at a crucial point in subject and needs to be taught. No substitute teacher is provided. In lower grades teacher only teaches LA and Math leaving 3 or 4 other subjects to be taught by the parent. I did not sign up to homeschool my children. I would expect a cyber public school, who is taking tax dollars from my local school district,  to educate my child in all subjects and teach every lesson as teachers do in my local school district. Also to have someone there teaching everyday, whether it be the teacher or a substitute teacher.","At the moment everything has been great.","You say you are a public school and receive the tax dollars that would normally go to my school district. I find that incorrect because I am constantly having to teach subjects that are not covered by a teacher. One child is in 4th grade and out of all the subjects he has, he is only taught Math and Language Arts by a 'real' teacher forcing the parent or what you like to call a 'learning coach' to teach the rest of the subjects.","I can't think of anything more than you are already doing.","By adding a newer ciriculum.","Will answer after she begins","Have to say my only issue is my 11th grade teachers not taking time to get back to me.  My 6th graders teachers are awesome.","CCA is doing a great job and I would not change a thing.","I would like more support on math and language arts for kid. I feel that kids should have more writing workshops with experts on the subject. Learning coaches are not necessary skilled teachers.","Some teachers need to be more attentive to students and there work. Live lessons should be educational but also not boring.","More communication with the parents, and more videos on being a better coach.  Thank you.","Nothing to say here!  You guys are great!","So far we are pleased and have no complaints.","Always continue to look for better related service providers in the Lehigh Valley that can work with students with disabilities\r\nListen to the feedback from the families in regards to there service providers/staff.  Maybe looking to have your Related Service Co-Ordinator connect with the families to see how they like and how they work with there providers since the school personnel do not work hand and hand with them as CCA staff does.  I think a Special Education/Related Service survey should go out to families that are enrolled in special education services to provide feedback in this area","I really have nothing negative to say about CCA.

Also it would be very helpful to have the links for the planner, gradebook, and webmail appear in separate tabs so that you may have more than 1 item open at anytime for comparison, ie: what the planner shows for a given day, versus the webmail sent by a teacher of their schedule for the week, versus the gradebook so you can see what your student has completed.","No ideas at this time.","n/a","Can't think of anything.

Even if it was only a once a month meet up with a concert at the end of the year. Perhaps floating staff members or even musically skilled parents could be designated to cover each region/hold the \"practices\" at each CCA office...almost like having regional bands??? For example: \"CCA-Northeast Region Band\"\r\n2. CCA offers MANY wonderful field trips. But to be honest, the ones that my son enjoys the most are the simple ones that are most like a GYM class...similar to what he would have in regular school. I wonder if there might be a way to foster more of those GYM classes....perhaps even on a monthly basis. I think it would be a great way to help the kids feel a sense of school community with a group of peers.\r\n3. The field trips offered that focus on specific grades/Gifted classes working directly with their actual teachers are a terrific opportunity for students to feel connected to their class. My son very much enjoyed those this year and we hope there will be more in the future.

When we have any difficulties it is with figuring out how to do things.","Unsure how the change from National to state will either benefit or harm our students based on our experience of the \"quality\" and priorities of certain school administrators/staff.  Frankly, it seems like a corporate raiding  scam by administrators to collect our tax $ for personal use and avoid paying Connections Academy for their resources.  Losing the CCA national affiliation may hurt students not just in quality of education but may effect recognition and admissions by Colleges and Universities.","Honestly the portfolios do get to be a bit overwhelming especially when you have a child who is struggling in some subjects and needs to take extra time with them.","Return to 4 day option for live lessons. Or more closely align lectures to course material.","Partner with real brick and mortar schools as a supplement but not primary \"education\"","Get rid of the Approaching Alarm &amp; Alarm statuses from your home page.  This is our 9th year with CCA, and we have never experienced these statuses before. My daughter has been in either one or the other of these statuses about every 2 to 3 weeks throughout this entire school year.  It gets annoying and there is no reason for it.  It gives the reason as no teacher contact, even though she attends several live lesson with teachers every week.  I have had to contact her homeroom teacher so many times this year to have the status fixed.  I hated to bother him, and he probably hated hearing from me.  I would suggest finding a fix for that asap to cause less stress for the student, parents, and teachers.","Nothing, it's a great school system!","Nothing, their great!","Their great, just not sure about high school yet.","The amount of portfolios is a little overwhelming and causes anxiety for my children.

In my opinion it does not prepare them for their future college experience. Assignments should be made and completed by a set time!

It would be helpful, for example, if lessons were only scheduled 4 days per week, with the 5th school day reserved for portfolios, experiments and precious time to delve further into an interesting topic on the planner that week.","I am extremely satisfied!","One problem we've run into this year was Approaching Alarm status wouldn't go away for a few weeks even though my son was totally caught up on lessons. The homeroom teacher couldn't help right away either.","n/a","We have found all aspects satisfying","Fix the field trip issues. This year you could only go on one paid trip a month. This cause a lot of cancellations because if there weren't enough people for a trip, it was cancelled. We signed up for trips that were cancelled so he had no trips to go on. If people are willing to pay for second trip why can't they go. Also if a person is signing her kid up for 3 trips a week then maybe limit to 3 paid trips a month. Not one paid trip a month. Some mothers with 2 or 3 or even 4 kids had hardship because different kids wanted different trips and then families had to be split up.","The only thing I was very disappointed in this year were the field trips and the limits put on them...First there weren't many that we were interested in and then if we did seem to find a few they were both pay and in the same month so we went months with out going on any and then only got to go on one even though there were more we liked in the same month.I also dint like that the grade field trip counted as your payed trip for the month and the fact it was only me and my son that could attend most which was hard if it was a distance having to drive alone. There needs to be a better set up for next year.","I know because of the budget this year there were major changes with the field trips and i was very disappointed over that...I liked having more things at our CCA center but i miss having all the great trips like years past.. We have yet to go on any other then at CCA. We will be going on Two with in the coming months but considering we use to go on at least one a month this is very disappointing.","CCA has done everything to give our children a wonderful experience and the learning tools that they need to be successful.","we are happy with CCA","Honestly I am completely satisfied with CCA. I do wish there were more social opportunities aside from field trips.","Connections Academy in general needs to be a little bit easier to enroll a student. Parents seem to get frustrated with enrollment. Need to make sure every student gets a free laptop,printer ink and a printer. Laptops should be switched out and given to students, a new one every 3 years a student completes 3 years in CCA. Every time a family stays in CCA for 5 years or more, you should send the family a Thank you. Congratulate them for sticking with the school. Promote school spirit!! Give some freebies like CCA shirts,pencils,pens and notepads. People in general love being appreciated. The end of school year picnics (Hershey Park) should return. Have each family pay half for their tickets. No extended family, only immediate family.(2 adults and siblings). Break up the days at Hershey Park. Kindergarten to 5th grade goes on a Friday in May. Sixth grade to 12 grade and families go on a Friday in June. Only have meal time at the pavilon from 12pm to 2pm. Than your on your own. Families pay to get there, plus parking. We have been with CCA for seven years,we love it,with the budget cuts we lost a lot. CCA needs to figure out how to keep families for more than 2 years. The families that have stuck with Connections Academy for many years, are the ones who promote and talk about the school to other families. When they are happy they spread positive feedback.","I would like to see A-Sync offered in Middle School so that students can work at their own pace.  I would like to see \"B\" courses opened early if a child finishes all the \"A\" courses before December.","CCA is wonderful. I saw this year that CCA was trying more social gatherings for the kids which I feel is fantastic however I think they should break them up more into categories or age groups. My daughter was excited to attend the one but when she signed on to the live lesson she didn't prefer it because she's in 7th grade and that live social gathering went up to grade 12th. So the interests were all over the place and ages.  I think the concept is brilliant but maybe just break them into smaller groups by age and/or interests.","unknown","It is to early for me to tell.","Supply text books in all subjects for high school and middle school.","They can not right now. They are a great school.","Honestly, there is nothing CCA could do better. My husband and I researched schools all over the state, and in some cases other states, and we were constantly disappointed in the other schools. Prior to CCA, we looked and toured several private schools and again were highly disappointed. We are not only very satisfied with CCA but also relieved that our children are getting the best education while remaining safe and away from the bully issues of brick and mortar schools.","Give more options as far as testing and portfolios in all grade levels.  Two of my daughter's teachers offered a \"path 2\" option this year.  All her tests, quizzes, and portfolios were dropped;  however, she had to complete a project at the end of each unit.  She usually chooses to make a power point presentation summarizing everything from each lesson.  I feel that she has learned so much more by doing this than taking the tests and doing the portfolios. She does spend more time working on these projects than she would on the portfolios and studying for test; however, the amount of learning is definitely worth it.  I wish this was an option at every level.","I am completely satisfied with CCA.","CCA is an amazing school, but guidance does take awhile to get back in touch with graduating seniors. Also some sport teams would be nice.","I do not like how many \"portfolios\" there are.  I don't think that all of these projects are as good of a learning experience as other choices for learning.  Some of the classes seemed rather  boring.  I have homeschooled my children and have found so much exciting learning material out there -  I just think there are better, more exciting learning opportunities that can be incorporated without so many projects that do not allow you to move forward until you have completed the project.","I have really appreciated my family mentor. She has been so helpful with navigating and understanding the information available to me as a parent/coach. The only issue I have is that my husband and I both work full-time so it makes attending many of the social events difficult. We are heavily involved in youth programs at church, so my daughter has plenty of \"socialization\". But I feel like she may be missing out on some things simply because I cannot get the time off to take her. She falls behind in some of her projects too because of me as well. I am wondering if maybe there would be a way for students with working parents to have \"assistant coaches?\" or maybe there is a resource that I don't yet know about?","I have been very satisfied with CCA.    If it continues to operate the same manner, I would be happy","CCA does a excellent job as is.....  The only one thing I would suggest is having the children spend a little time with their teachers in person. Maybe like once a month have the teachers and students meet at the school so that they can all interact and take some pictures for their school year book! I love home schooling my son. But he does get sad when he sees his friends and they have year books and all their friends signed it! It would be really nice if CCA could do that. My son has been with CCA since 4th grade. He still talks about his teacher \"Miss Miller\" He always wanted to meet her, but he never did.   :(    He's in 7th grade now.... Mr. Hooks class. He met him on picture day. He was so nice! He came out to meet with Lukacs and I. He took a picture with Luke and it made his day! He told me mom.... How will all my teachers know that they helped me and that I appreciate them? I told him that he can always e-mail them. But when he reaches his goals in life that, that will be validating and rewarding on it's own!","Can't think of anything...","In person meet and greet with course teachers at the beginning of the year.-My 10th grader\r\nHave some live lessons to just meet people in classes.-6th grader","CCA has met our every need.","I think CCA is doing a bang up job.","I am fully satisfied with CCA","For elementary school, I would like to see live lessons available for science and social studies at least once or twice a week. I prefer a teacher instructing my child rather than me. I believe the interaction with the teacher and their creative lessons will help my student understand the material.  \"Mom is boring.\"","teachers do not always respond to webmail....I have reached out to most, but some did not respond......guidance counselor has been great.....","As of right now I feel CCA is doing a fantastic job!","More field trips in the north east area! You can make students be host in their own livelesson so they can teach their friends or even chat with them so they don't feel so lonely.","I would like to see a little more variety in electives for high school.","I would like to see live lessons offered one or two days a weeks for elementary science, social studies, technology class and art.  My kids do not work independently, so without a live lesson, they rely on me to read through the lessons.  It's difficult for me having more than one child in the program to give them the help they need.  Also, as a busy mom, I have household chores to fit into my daily schedule.","I'm not sure, I think the only thing that confuses me is the attendance schedule. I'm not sure how to mark days that the school is closed, Maybe you already have that somewhere and I just don't know where to find it?","I know there are procedures to be followed when asking for certain help, but sometimes it is the red tape that turns parents off to coming to ask for help. Maybe make it a little easier for children to get the help they need without it being such a bothersome and long process (asked for an IEP meeting at the end of the last school year, and am only now finally getting an evaluation - and that's still predicated on receiving the PTE).","I'm honestly unsure if they can very satisfied","I truly don't know of any way to make me happier with my daughters schooling CCA is definitely for us!!!!!!!",null,"I can't think of anything CCA can do better at this time. My children have been very successful and doing very well.","There are too many portfolios, especially in the second half of the school year.  I know that my son could be learning more about the material and doing a better job, but knowing that he has three other portfolios due on top of all of the regular lessons each day is too much for a kid.  He doesn't even feel like he has time for live lessons lately, which doesn't help his grades.  Have one place for portfolio directions.  Some directions are in the kids' lessons, some are in the learning coaches' lessons, and others are sent in e-mail.  Very confusing.  More local groups and activities would be nice.  A local science fair, maybe having the chess club get together and play in person.","There are no complaints because all that was expected and more are being offered from this school.","I would like access to things like Skills Tutor over the summer so my kids can continue math practice. Also, find a way to give ongoing feedback about teachers/field trips/etcs. Change the field trip policy - one paid per month is too limiting. I would be happy to pay for additional field trips.","Start live lessons immediately at the beginning of the school year (there is currently a 1-2 week gap). Reduce the impact that PSSA's have on the student (teacher miss live lessons, reduced field trips during PSSA's, etc.). Start live lessons for social studies and science earlier than 5th grade. Provide enrichment for students based on iReady scores. Be able to provide feedback on each teacher and each subject at least twice per year. Keep Learning Coaches updated as to the changes occurring within CCA and proposed changes for the following school year. Allow more than 1 paid field trip per month. Do not have grade level and STEM field trips count as the 1 paid field trip per month (or allow more than 1 paid field trip per month). Have more clubs that meet in person  once per month - like robotics club and Odyssey of the Mind.

There is a HUGE difference between the attitude of elem and middle school staff.  I understand the kids are needing to be more independent but there is no need for rudeness or calling them lazy.   Also upgrade computer systems, we have been having issue when submitting tests and quizzes answer are not being shown as entered when they are.  This needs to be fixed and addressed.  Since all assignments are online this is a huge hassle trying to get lessons reset.","satisfied with CCA","Happy with CCA","We really don't like temporary zeros.  I feel it's not a motivational tool.  It is discouraging for the student not to be able to see his or her true grade.","More field trips closer to our area. Most are to far for me to travel to.","Have middle school teachers and administration respond to emails and complaints better.  Would really appreciate if teachers would keep their political views to themselves and not force there views and lies onto the students.   They are hired to teach a subject.  When teaching history teach history.  Do not compare the current president to a dictator that gassed and murdered millions of people.  When he has done no such thing.  Teachers need to keep their religious views to themselves as well.  If you are going to teach about religion teach about ALL of them.","seams good wouldn't change","More tutoring","We would like to see more local field trips.","So far everything has been great and I can't think of anything.","We work well independently and would prefer fewer portfolio items.  So much time is spent (as a learning coach) scanning and sending paperwork.  I will have 3 children in CCA next year.  Portfolio items are going to be overwhelming!!!!!","Adding more field trips in our area.","The only downfall I seen is the live lessons sometimes change or they email you the day of them at different times sometimes an hr before the lesson, and if you have already checked your email  you dont know there is one or it changed.

I think you do a pretty good job. I am not a fan of common core, but realize that you are offering public education. I also hate the teaching to test, but again realize that is forced on you by the state mandates.","Because we have multiple students in CCA, we find that the portfolios become overwhelming especially if they fall one right on top of the other.

Such as, a 4th grader obviously knows how to write at this point. Having to hand-write everything is tedious to them and they become less enthused to do it. I believe they should be able to type their papers and such as this is the way things are done in the majority of life. I would also like to see live lessons for science and social studies. The amount of reading they must do and absorb is difficult. I think that hearing the information will help them understand better.","would like to see more field trips closer than a 2 hour drive","Nothing at this time.","I dont know. I dont feel like the elementary program is very good. my children are rushed through 20 stories and not given enough time to really understand the spelling and grammer stuff. I always feel like there is a deadline looming. there is too much rushing. trying to fit more then is needed, quantity is not quality in this case. as for my 8th grader and 9th grader. again rushing through topics not really exploring anything.  I wish I could say otherwise but we have been considering leaving to traditionally home school for sometime now. I have been with cca for 10 years. I dont want to leave but I havent been feeling like the education is quality anymore. I want my children to love learning not view it as a chore to be finished as fast a possible. they are always fighting some deadline.","Make sure my son graduates before he ages out","CCA has done a great job with serving my children","things are going pretty good right now","Nothing that I can think of.  This year has been our best year yet.  Happy with everything.  \r\nThe only thing that has just been slightly disheartening, is that for each of my daughters, have had their K year interrupted by teachers having babies.  It feels a bit more isolated when you do not have the teacher that you came into the school year with.  This is nothing that is the fault of the school but thought I would just mention it seems to happen a lot and can be a bit difficult.","Change the frequency of the approaching alarm status on their home page. It is extremely inconvenient and annoying. My students turn assignments in on time  and get good grades. They may seldom attend live lessons, but because of their grades and discipline in keeping up with assignments, this doesn't concern me. In cases like this, they really don't need teacher contact more than once a month. With approaching alarm, we end up having to interrupt what we are doing to contact a teacher every 2 weeks.","I cannot think of anything that I would change.","There's nothing specific that comes to mind, but we would like to know if there is a chance that there will be an end of year, Hershey Park Trip.","The only thing that we missed was the year end celebration. We are extremely satisfied with the integrity that the school possesses.","More support from teacher, better communication with teacher, more willingness to seek out alternative curriculum when what is currently being used isn't working.","I think everything is good! I'd love to hear more about Box Tops, and the Hershey Park trip! It's amazing to finally meet the people that have been teaching out children all year!","Don't allow the stress from the unclear and uncertainty of life deter you from the purpose of CCA. If you find yourself becoming like the others than that's a clear indication that you are going the wrong way and make a U-turn. Continue to be different by proving us with innovative, project based curriculums. Continue to allow and support differences in learning, build on strength and not weakness. Provide etiquette class for all children along with social skills training. Make learning a thirst needing to be quenched. Find the tools to inspire even when inspiration seems unattainable.","satisfied","CCA is doing an awesome job and I am completely satisfied in our 5th year with CCA.","Once the budget is settled, I'd love to see more field trips and maybe they Hershey Park trip to come back.","I feel there needs to be better communication between teachers and students. Sometimes it takes days to hear back if my student has reached out.  The teachers never seem to keep tabs on how my student is doing and if he is falling behind or inquire what they might do to help, UNTIL I as a parent make a phone call.  Some of the teachers do not cover the same material in class as the students are expected to learn in the online lessons... After a while my student feels like this is just a big waste of time as there is so much to cover in online work.  It is even worse if the teacher wants the students to discuss topics for a whole class- as if they are really teaching anything. \r\n\r\nI think it would be beneficial if the classes met more than one or maybe two times a week.  How is a student in Spanish 3 suppose to learn  conversational language this way? In the higher level math classes twice a week is barely enough either. My other children were enrolled in a different cyber school and their classes met more frequently and I believe it worked better for the students.  \r\n\r\nSome of the elective classes are almost entirely self taught.  What is up with that?  My kid could learn the material online without being enrolled in cyber school.\r\n\r\nAnd while we have had some very good, engaged teachers while at CCA, I would say we have had more that were not.  Sad to say, but true. \r\n","More activities","I don't have any problems","I can't think of any way that CCA can better serve us.","More communication regarding the support and process through guidance for college",null,"I can't think of anythng. We're haply with CCA.","na",null,"n/a","Provide better services for special education, Mental Disabilities Students, and courses that are individual to that need.  As of this year, we had experienced great difficulty in courses that required great independence.  This has not worked well for us as in all other years at CCA he was in a much more fitted course.  Also there are no electives that my child with intellectual disability could take yet we were asked to pick 2.  As well as in the intent to return we had to pick courses that will obviously not work for us as there were only options for general education.  This will impede on the beginning of the year when he is put in general education waiting for special education courses even though he has been a returning student for the last four years.  This should not be a difficult task each year to get started in the school year.","I would like for the teachers to communicate with the parent and student more often.  I would like to see the work set up in a more clear and organized way.  you have the daily planner , but it doesn't always coincide with what the teacher wants done. So it can be a bit confusing at times.","You guys are doing just fine right now just re-enrolled.","I can not think of anything that CCA can do to better serve our family.","I am completely satisfied.","Improving the curriculum would be very helpful.","fine","n/a","They are serving us very well, thank you!","more opportunities to meet directly with teachers. more meet and greets at the beginning of the year. It is nice to put a name to a face (I do like the pictures of the teachers on the emails) \r\nI am very disappointed with the new way of doing field trips. If it is a monetary issue then being able to spend a certain amt would make more sense. we rarely took advantage of field trips this year (except STEM, which by the way are the best!) Back to field trips. It was way to confusing to decide how we wanted to use our one trip for the month and I certainly never signed up for trips that only cost a few dollars. I believe those trips suffered. If the reason was because people signed up and did not show up then shame on them and make them pay for the next trip they want to go on bu don't make it difficult for the rest of us. Also although I appreciate the loyalty thing I believe that new families should have the same opportunities without having to pay more.","Fix live lesson schedule! Please go back to the way live lessons were done prior to this year! My children all enjoyed attending live lessons and did so frequently or watched recordings. Now they attend about 25% of the time. It is very confusing and teachers do not mark them for attendance regularly so they are often in alarm.  We were extremely satisfied with CCA prior to this year. Teacher follow up has declined also which I find disappointing. My daughters honors science teacher does not even bother to do live lessons.","I think that the lesson structure needs to be re-evaluated to encourage students to read and be able to do projects in advance prior to the dropbox showing up in the lesson. What I have found with the structure is that a paper is assigned at the end of a lesson and the student cannot move ahead without turning in the completed paper. This delays their progress and the students can find themselves falling behind because they cannot complete a subsequent lesson until the prior is submitted. I think this causes the students to rush and not work as completely or as well as they might if they were assigned an essay on a Monday to be handed in on Friday. Then they can complete daily lessons and work on the essays as homework. Cyber schooled kids definitely could use more \"homework\" to get used to having to work outside of the \"classroom\" so to speak. I have learned to work around the system by looking ahead, but I'm not sure other kids have that kind of support from their coaches.","everything is great","Get rid of \"Alarm\" system","I think everyone is doing a great job. Can't do better :)","I have no problems .","Teachers should speak to parents even when the students are in the higher grades and getting good grades.","Some of my son's I.E.P documents talk about services for transition. He has yet to utilize them because we don't know where to start. The case manager should put time into each special ed student to make sure that they are getting the services they claim in the I.E.P","In the earlier grades, I really Loved CCA! But, high school seems to be struggling. My son has an IEP due to his learning difficulties and health issues. He is struggling with the B part of his math classes, as they have changed the format to a video only assignment. You watch the video or go to the class and no longer have an assignment. He gets lost in his mind during the classes, or the videos and was doing much better with the power point classes and live lessons. Now he is so behind and no one has contacted him or myself after several emails.","Continue on the path CCA is already on. It's been a wonderful 6 years and we look forward to many more before her graduation.","Continue to provide excellent field trips and opportunities for students to interact with fellow students and their teachers.  Plan more field trips at school offices to correspond with the curriculum.","My only complaint about the curriculum is that the Art lessons are much too mature for a fourth grader; the result being that my child resents the art lessons. Too much reading and very little creativity. The unfortunate result has been him wanting nothing to do with art at CCA, while he did not mind art before.","I think everything is great.","Keep doing what you have over the last 7 years. Continue to employ the best teachers in the state and challenge the students with the curriculum. The flexibility CCA offers is wonderful as well.","I wish some of the teachers would respond to emails a little better.","The curriculum is outdated.","n/a",null,"I wish that there was a better gifted or accelerated program.   It is my opinion that the 5th grade curriculum was easier than the 4th grade curriculum.  The curriculum should be getting more difficult to prepare students for Middle School and High School not easier.   My son was often bored this past year.   When looking into the gifted program for him I found that is wasn't more enriching. It was only more busy work.  The gifted math program only skips the student ahead a year in math.  How can you skip a whole year of Math? Math builds on prior knowledge.   These are areas that I think CCA needs to improve upon.    Also, most or the teachers we have had with CCA have been excellent.  They have always exceeded our expectations.  However this year my son's Science/SS teacher left us feeling frustrated.  He did the bare minimum that was required of him.  His live lessons consisted of showing the videos that were already in the lessons.  His reviews were copied from somewhere else and often didn't even coincide with the curriculum.    It seemed like his heart was not in teaching.  I look at a teacher as a service industry.  They are helping to shape our future.  If a teacher is not interested in inspiring and helping stuedents learn then teaching is not the right profession for them in my opinion.","You need to get back to the basics and  work on focusing on educating students. They are our future! Gifted program stinks! You have two teachers who obviously don't get along and this is evident and affects your students. Sadly, we have experience this two years in a row. One teacher is not gifted teacher material. No communication, lack of posting to message board, no information regarding portfolios, LL recording posted 2 weeks late really doesn't help. No control in LL. First 10-15 minutes wasted with nonsense. No encouragement. No feedback on tests or portfolios. Too many mistakes in answer key book and in lessons. Recently, tried to view rubric in 5th grade science only to find a 4th grade rubic on something completely different. iReady testing nightmare. Lack of instruction given for testing and results. Lack of answer key available for SS. If there is a review in the book there should be answers available. No consistency among teachers. CCA is NOT flexible. LL are advertised as 'not mandatory' but are highly frowned upon when not attending,   No reply from teachers or principal. Tech. Support telling us we can skip graded section in lesson instead of fixing problem. Thanks to CCA for my students confidence and love of learning to tank. Don't put teachers in position to teach grades they are not ready to handle. SUPPORT, COMMUNICATE, &amp; EDUCATE! That is how CCA can better serve my student. I have more but I'm sure this has fallen on deaf ears. I am passionate about my students education. I wish CCA was too.","Please help us solve our technical issues?\r\nWe have experienced \"daily\" technical issues with CCA issued equipment, connectivity, and webmail that has never been resolved. We have had no response to our concerns or what to do about the webmail issues and connectivity issues from our child's principal. Tech support has advised us that our webmail issues are not \"technical\" and will not address them. Our suggestion, based on our technical expert that we hired says the issues are within the CCA environment and the possible solution would be to remove our account and reinstall it -- possibly eliminating the glitches. This suggestion was rejected by tech support as well. It is fair to say that as her learning coach(s) we are very disillusioned by the experience the past 2 years. Its only because our child has progressed that we hang on.\r\nLastly, we have also noticed an abnormal amount of absences by her support teacher.  Tech issues and teacher absences has caused us \"not\" enroll our child in the summer program offered. We have chosen to avoid the frustration to stay connected technically, and also avoid last minute cancellations or waiting for her teacher to show up for class.","I really don't know since I haven't had any problems so far.","keep doing a great job. Thank you.","They can have a better environment.  Solve the technical difficulties during Live Lessons. Have teachers that understand special needs students.  Be more prepared when it comes to work, make sure it is on time, not the business hour (5pm is too late).","As of now they are doing all that they can\r\n","Don't need anything different. It's been a great program for my daughter so far.\r\nJust don't know if she's going to decide to return back to school next year or not yet","There is nothing that I would change currently about CCA.","Be sure to always respond in a timely manner to webmails and phone calls.","I really have no suggestions to make what you do better.  We have been extremely pleased with all CCA.","I have no problem with the program I like it. I just wish that there be more events in my area cause I don't drive or have a car\r\n","Continue to be available for parents who choose to take an active role in their child's education.","Ooo","Let me know what is going on with my child before its too late.  My son is still in 9th grade and he will be 17 this year.  The teachers do not follow up and they are less involved since he entered the high school level.  He got so far behind that he is discouraged.  I am upset.","Teachers are unresponsive most of the time, there is no structure to classes or curriculum. Some teachers follow the posted lesson plan, others do not. Too many classes require work outside the CCA website and I have NO way to check up on course or lesson completion. Teachers seem to have no authority to change the posted lessons, change due dates... It's just a horrible experience. Now they have what's considered a \"more flexible\" class schedule, which is an absolute unstructured disaster.","My child and I are both dissatisfied with CCA. It does not interest my child, and the program does not fit our lives. My child is not socially interactive and will be attending public high school in the district.","More interaction in live lessons.","We are good.  Thank You.","I think the school is doing a great job an the teacher. But my son well be going back to school because he want to go back","Listen to the parents and do the best for the students.

Though I am sure that as she moves forward this may not remain the same and she will appreciate that repetition when learning something harder later on. Maybe a way to test out of that unit if the knowledge is already there?",null,"im not sure","I can't think of anything.","Nothing really","I am very happy with CCA. It was a tough year for my daughter and enrolling in this new environment was very scary. I still am a bit unsure with the software. i try to learn as I go, but I am not completely confident.","Happy with service.","Have information for all children of working age assesable to parents for working papers etc.","There is nothing at this point","The teachers in the 8th grade can give a little more guidance on what is expected on projects and portfolios. My son is struggling to keep up his grades when he is doing work very similar to his brother in 7th grade. The teachers in 7th grade are very good at letting you know what is expected and are more understanding in their grading practices. My son has brain damage and is doing so well keeping up with the 7th grade curriculum. My son without special needs is struggling in 8th grade.","They are amazing.  I have no complaints","I love CCA, but as with anything, improvements can always be made. I feel that the live lessons could be a little longer. Right now, we have 2 live lessons only 1/2 hour each. I feel this does not provide enough time for the amount of children participating in the class nor enough time on the subject being taught. I think some subjects deserve more time spent teaching and reteaching through the live lessons. ( children love to learn off from each other and it helps with the teaching part of a subject ). Also, the field trips provided by CCA are wonderful not only for the educational part but also for the socialization between the parents and children in the school. I would love to see more outings for the parents even if constructed at a local park such as Lackawanna State Park etc. etc. Parents could bring their own snacks and lunches but it would get many of the students a chance to meet others without cost to the school. We have attended the Dickson City office and loved the field trips there as well. The Science field trips really seem to be a hit for all the kids, since the interaction gets them all involved. We are looking forward to another year with CCA. We love our school !","I would love to see Live Lessons available to elementary students in all subjects.","Honestly, I think CCA has been wonderful and the service that is provided is more than adequate.","I would love if Live Lessons were offered to elementary grades for all subjects. I would also like Live Lessons to be mandatory and not optional.","not sure","I don't know","There is a program for public school  teachers to get discounts at places like Staples and all they have to show is I.D. We need a program like that for home schooling families.","The only trouble with CCA that I found was navigating the software. My child found it rather easy, but it took me some time.","I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING I CAN CHANGE, EVERYTHING IS GREAT THE WAY IT IS.","N/A","I am just concerned that my son isn't reading at an 8th grade level. He takes advantage of the video and audio lessons, while going over work with me. My son doesn't do any work independently. I worry he will not pass the Keystone tests by himself. Can he still graduate? He has learning disabilities and requires modifications based on his IEP.","I don't know.","I can't think of anything right now.","Because my child is graduating, CCA can just continue to provide support to my student to help him finish the school year confidently, celebrate graduation, and transition to college life.  (I really have appreciated the timely budget updates to relieve some concern during the school year.  I'm glad that budget problems have not impacted my son's final year of HS and his graduation.)","We are extremely satisfied with CCA.","Be able to provide physical one on one tutoring when requested .","Keep the GT curriculum and provide challenging courses.","My son requires accommodations for various reasons and I would like to have the option of \"face to face\" therapy for some of them.  More activities at the offices would be great too- he would like to have more time with friends through the week.","We would have liked our son to do a duel-enroll program with our local college, but he had to take a full load at CCA which did not allow him to take the courses he wanted at the college.  If the college course would have satisfied the graduation requirements we are not sure why he couldn't take that instead.","I feel as though many of your portfolio rubrics are vague. I often find myself webmailing the teachers to clarify information. I would also rather see more languages offered to younger elementary level classes, like 1st or 2nd grade. My son (2nd grade) attended a homeschool co op this year in order to start learning French. I would have preferred to have him attend CCA. And I really would like to see Latin offered as a class as well. I have been teaching Latin words to my son to help expand his vocabulary. I understand that not all children and/or families would be interested in this, but perhaps it can be offered as an elective??","I'm not sure. I think CCA has done a great job.","I honestly believe it's perfect the way that it is","RespoND to emails faster","Would like to have a weekly list of live lessons that were attended \"live\" as they were happening.","The teachers are changing the tests, portfolios, discussions and most of the time their directions are too complicated and sometimes even confusing. For example the English teacher for one unit had 10 files of instructions on three threads and there was no rubric. Study Island is a place to practice and even read a summary about a topic, the English teacher is grading that too. Benchmarks are just a tool for teachers to plan better to teach students, the English teacher is grading those as well. \r\nYou need to provide test, and portfolios with clear instructions that are not too long. Also I still don't see any benefit in the \"Discussion\" that was added to your curriculum four years ago. It is a wrong way for the students who never meet each other to judge each other with the comments that have to make for their grades! \r\nI personally liked the curriculum before you allowed the teachers to set up their confusing and long rules. When parents are the learning coaches to work alongside and in reality more than the teachers with the students, then confusing instructions and time consuming instructions are not a plus for your system. You need to have a solid curriculum and schedule like Connexus.","n/a","I honestly think your Learning Support Dept needs more teachers so that they can give better one on one attention to their students. Kindergarten teachers need to remember that their students are only 5 and 6 and need to let them learn at their own pace and not what the teacher thinks they need to be at. If i knew that Kindergarten was like it is I would have not signed my daughter up this year.","im very satisfied on how they already serve me","NA","Unsure","they meet all my needs already","We are very pleased with how CCA served us this school year.","I really don't have an answer .","Teachers can be more helpful and focused on ensuring my child's education.","they are doing an excellent job! thank you. i can't think of any more my daughter needs. i believe that you get as much as you are willing to take in!","I am very happy with CCA","The teachers could be more understanding of home-life situations and struggles the kids endure with mental health and other factors.","I'm very satisfied with CCA","I feel CCA has served me and my son well enough","I believe CCA does great. I really don't see where they can improve. My daughter should do more herself by doing the live lessons. She just watches them. So her part is lacking not the school.","I really don't see a problem with CCA. My child just needs to apply herself better.","There's nothing better then it already is !!","update equipment","By continuing to answer promptly to any concerns or questions that my children or myself may have.","Serve us the same.","They already go out of their way over 1000%.. anything to change!!!","I think you need to rethink some of the senior classes. I dont see it necessary for web designing and other classes","I think it is an amazing school already, the only thing I would even consider criticizing would be it may need more career electives that would help someone like my son. He has chosen to be a technical educator and has been accepted at a 4yr college. He would have liked to have taken more courses that would have followed that kind of curriculum. Overall it has been a great experience for him and he wishes he had enrolled sooner.","The service is excellent as is. Enrolling in CCA has been a life changer for us.

But if your child is not there yet or forgets to go back through the webmails to find the one that says oh by the way I totally changed up the next lesson and your child turns in what was originally asked. Well let's just say it gets irritating.  And leaves your child confused and frustrated!","I feel CCA serves me so well. I don't have nothing bad to say. One thing that could help is the learning coach have access to teacher message boards. I have to go back and forth through accounts.","unsure\r\n","No comment as of yet. My daughter just started the program today.","It would be better to not have students attend every live lesson. Messaging teachers should count as keeping in touch. There should be a requirement for teachers to respond within 48 hours.","Don't have elementary live lessons all at the same time.  Have different grade levels at different times.  This made it VERY difficult for me (learning coach) to sit with both my kindergarten and first grade student during live lessons.  I don't know how I'm suppose to pay attention to both and not have both students distracted by each other.  It has been a nightmare this year because of this.  I need to sit with both to see what their learning to help me know what I need to further teach and see what they are not understanding in class.  \r\nAlso I feel that since homeschooling should be family based, younger siblings (age 3-4)  should be allowed to join in on field trips.  I can understand certain field trips can't accommodated certain ages but I believe most can.  And I think all field trips except socials should accommodated all grade levels if there are other students (siblings) present since they have to be there because obviously they can't stay home by themselves.  You have to remember that in most house holds there's only one learning coach around during the day.  It doesn't make sense to have them sit out when they can be learning something too.  This is why we decided not to go to the 4th and 5th grade field trips.  If all my students could participate then we would of went to both.  Especially since its far from where we live.  \r\nWe would like to see the science labs (all grade levels) become field trips at the CCA offices to get better learning and hands on experience with the science teachers.  It would also benefit the families since its not easy to afford all the supplies to do these experiments and it would be more fun to do this as a group. \r\nIt is really important to our family for this school to come up with a music group at the CCA (DC) office.  It would be GREAT to have students learn an instrument or join a choir.  It would be nice to see a small little band or orchestra group perform at the office.","I am very satisfied","I do wish there was a better way to make the kids more accountable  togo to live lesson.","Not sure","Keep up the good job","Revise there policy for high school home school transfers. There is a way to mathematically not include their home school grades into their CCA GPA but present the grades to colleges.","Nothing I love every thing about the school","They are great at what they are doing...No cpmplaints","I have not had any problems yet while being in this school system.","I find there is a lack of communication for new parent regarding how to reach staff and and get answers to questions. Initially I did not understand anything about cyber school, I called multiple times and got voice mail. I even reached out to the president of my sight without response. Very frustrating. I know the parent mentors began calling but that was well into the start of the year. I work full time. I am m daughters learning coach. I voiced concern that I am not at home 40 hrs per week. Unsure this is a good format for full time working moms.","My son is a 5th grade student with a 504 plan.  It has taken this ENTIRE school year for further testing and evaluations to be done (that I showed and expressed concern about LAST year) and we STILL have not finalized his treatment plans (504 adjustments or IEP started) based on the findings.  My biggest concern was him transitioning to middle school without a proper plan in place for him to excel and at this point in time we are into the final marking period for 5th grade and still no resolve. I've done everything on my part (counseling, psychiatrist, medications, evaluations, forms, correspondence) but it seems for every step of the process I've had to chase down someone for the next step or answers.  I'm thinking the focus on your special education department could use some reconfiguring.","So far So good!","At this time, I don't have any requests that aren't being met already.","Offer vo tech to their students","At this time there is not much I would change.  We are currently in our 4th year with CCA and everything is working well for both my children.  If I had to ask for anything more I would ask that teachers in the Middle School level provide a weekly or monthly Lesson plan for the coaches to make sure their students are on track.  Several times this year I have had to contact the teachers to ask \"what lesson should my child be on as of today?\"  Some teachers are already doing this, but others do not.  My daughter has one teacher that she is lucky if she even gets one email a month... and those emails do not consist of any course importance.  SO yes, more communication regarding lesson schedules would be great, especially on Fridays for the coming week or near holiday breaks and so forth.","They are doing a great job","Continue what they are doing, my Daughter in public school was failing almost every class, and would not get help when she asked.","keep up the good work","I am happy. Thank you CCA for listening to me.","Not everything is going good so far.","I can't think of anything.

Was very disappointed that it wasn't more one on one hands on training.","Teach, not teach on how to take the pssa","I would love if there were more challenging curriculum options for my son. He is only in 1st grade, so CCA may offer more challenges naturally as he gets older, but for now we can usually proceed through the lessons without him having any difficulty. There already are some \"extension\" options in Language Arts, so maybe a few lessons considered \"extra challenging\" or the like could be embedded in the regular lesson. Overall, I couldn't be more pleased with this school. It has exceeded my highest expectations.","nothing","Make classes follow a more uniform plan.","I can't think of any way right now.","I'm satisfied with the service.","At times my child is frustrated by the lack of reasonably prompt responses from the teachers.  It is not every teacher, but my child has had teachers that do not respond to email inquiries about assignments or other questions in a prompt manner...sometimes not at all.  There has been similar experiences with a guidance inquiry at one time, too.  So I would suggest that teachers be more available to respond in a timely manner to emails.  Finally, teachers should check assignments and return them in a timely manner.  My child had a teacher last year that complained a lot that she was \"busy\" and had a lot of things going on in her life so assignments, papers, and tests were not graded and returned for weeks.  If a teacher expects a student to complete an assignment by a certain time/date, the teacher should also be as mindful and respectful about returning graded work.  It is frustrating to hear a teacher complain that they are busy...students are busy, too.","I wish Mr. Azzolina was a better communicator, not only with students, but with parents as well. I also wish his message board was created the same way as all the other teachers at CCA. It is hard to get around. I send him webmails and I get ignored.","None.","Help the children learn things that they don't understand that helps us out because we don't know most of what they are learning and it's hard on us and them they need to understand it more better.","N/A","Disappointed in the change of curriculum for pre-algebra.

Multiple times through the school year I had to ask the teachers to run the scheduler to get him back on track with the class.

I still have no idea why it was happening.","you are doing a great job..","No suggestions","I would like to see the website restructured to make it easier to find information on the school and teachers.

I think those systems could be more user friendly. It would also be helpful if kids had a way to get to know other kids in their classes, like an individual profile about each child with their interests and hobbies, where kids could find out more about the other kids, or an easier way to located kids in their local area.  A lot of the field trips are for all ages, and my child does not do well with younger kids. It would be nice if there were more field trips or socialization opportunities specific to their grade level.","Make the Live lessons be about the current lesson and topic. The student should have one teacher per subject, not a group of teachers...it's too confusing. The school should better inform new parents that their children can still attend activities at their brick and mortar district.

I also think that there should be more Portfolio options! The reason being is so the student can choose what they both prefer correlating to the curriculum, and what they enjoy. Also, with CBAs, I think they should be planned; not abrupt calls. Usually the teacher call when the student is busy ((usually in Livelesson)), and you end up rescheduling and playing a game of phone tag. An alternative to this can be the teacher makes a Google Form for the student, send it in a WebMail to the class, and then also record the times that are occupied for other students so it does not create any discrepancies--this would be a little more efficient for the family. Something also with CBAs- sometimes they aren't very connected to the curriculum; but rather just an abrupt assessment for the student. It might be beneficial if they go over an assessment together instead and the teacher decides if they get the credit. For incorrect responses, discuss with them why they are wrong, and reward them with the credit they deserve. After discussing incorrect responses, they also should receive credit. This is for an increased level of efficiency for students and families. Family Mentoring- Personally, I believe that Family Mentoring should be optional. I really find it useless, as I already know all of the information in the phone call... I think newly enrolled families should have the option to be assigned to a family mentor, because really, they likely know all or most the information. There should be like a system where familes can request a mentor. Once assigned, they can reach out and say, \"hey. I am struggling with this. Please help? I am availabale at this time by phone call.\" Quite frankly, in simpler terms, Family Mentoring has been pointless- we already knew about the content in the phone calls. However, my son has LOVED this school so far. He LOVES his teachers and he LOVES the curriculum!! That is all that matters to me. These are just my opinions! :) Thanks for reading.","communication with parents could be better. for new students and parents starting out i feel we were very lost and not sure what to do at first. we didnt really have much help with it all except once my child started and then spoke with the teachers.","I can't think of anything you aren't already doing well","I am completely satisfied with every service available to me through cca.","I really don't have much to say to this.  I think CCA is a great school.  For the most part, they seem to really care.  The only thing I would have to say is I would encourage more training with high school administration and teachers.  In middle school, everyone was so responsive.  It is QUITE the CONTRARY in high school.  It is VERY tough to reach certain people.  I would encourage better training geared towards high school staff on this.  Please.","N/A","I  find that the curriculum can be a little difficult. The math portion of the curriculum does not give my son enough time to learn something new, before jumping on to the next  level of math. It is frustrating.

The only thing I'm not crazy about, and this would be any cyber school, is the lack of social time.  My sons favorite thing to do is play computer games so when he is not on the computer for school he is on the computer for fun.  I don't think this is healthy.  My only reason for possibly going back to a brick and mortar school would be to get him around other students.  Which by the way, he couldn't care less about. He's fine with not being around other kids.  I'm the one that isn't fine with it.","just have a better way for slowly learning kids to catch up or explain them a little better where the modified lessons are maybe create another folder","Better communication.","I not sure.","I'm good","I would like more disciplinary action for my student or if that is too harsh, perhaps a personal meeting with an administrator who could guide him into becoming more motivated.

Not all students in the Northeast Region have Learning Coaches home all day to assist them in their educational needs.\r\nEvaluate the Gifted and Talented Program.  CCA has an exceptional 3rd grade GT teacher, Mrs. Howard who takes the time to make a personal connection with each of her students, finds innovative ways to get her students to think outside the box and engages them on every level to motivate themselves to think beyond the lesson content. In 4th grade, Mrs. Nagle also connects with her students and allows them the flexibility to reach beyond the connexus projects to present a project that they are interested in.  Based on our experience of other GT teachers besides Mrs. Howard and Mrs. Nagle, we are seriously considering not continuing with the GT program next school year for our son.  CCA's GT program needs more teachers like Mrs. Howard and Mrs. Nagle to make the program successful.  It is unfortunate that over the past few years, the program has experienced a decrease in students enrolled in it.  Being in a cyberschool environment gives students the ability to work at their own pace.  With the GT program, it should go beyond that to allow students to focus on what interests them most &amp; push themselves to excel in everything they do. Having a gifted student that can create graphs in power point color blocks to make a bar graph for a project just because that is what the lesson plan says is telling that student that going above &amp; beyond is not necessary.  Or requiring them to handwrite LA drafts when they best brainstorm by typing is unfortunate.  Asking a GT student that gets easily overwhelmed to complete a question on the white board &amp; then not helping him/her when they clearly state that he/she is not sure what to do is embarrassing &amp; deters that student from attending LL's at all.",null,"CCA is doing an excellent job in educating my children.

Sometimes it's hard to work schedules around the mornings.","I am a Registered Dietitian, and one of my current roles is to go out into schools (grades K-12), and teacher nutrition education.   I conduct a 30 minute nutrition lesson and activity for each class, and provide the children with a healthy snack, once per month. There is a pre-planned topic of the month, and is tied into a theme, i.e, February- Heart Month/Valentines' Day, March, National Nutrition Month, etc., so it is such a fun way to learn these life skills. I can't help but think how we might incorporate such a \"class\" as an enrichment into CCA's the curriculum, as the children respond so well. I know providing a snack would not be a possibility in the cyber environment, however, perhaps, a live lesson demonstration of how to make the snack (we send the recipe home with parents, as well), might be nice. We also provide the teacher with a packet of information for the month (newsletter, games, short message of the day, etc., coloring sheets, etc.), so that he/she can continue the same nutrition/wellness topic for the remainder of the month (after I leave), within the classroom. My daughter (3rd grade) loves to bake and cook, so she gets excited when I ask her to help me prepare for these classes, so I'm just passing it along that I think some type of life skills/home economics type class for the younger grades would be a great idea to round out the education received at CCA.

The instruction is more towards college students.  Unless you plan on a career in art related fields, I feel this class can be eliminated.  It is long, boring and everyone has their own opinion of art.  Usually, our answers on the assessments fail because our opinions are not the same as the program.  Sad.

This is completely unacceptable. I feel once this school has gotten so big us families who have been with the school since the beginning are all but forgotten. I have had numerous teachers tell me not to bother them. I do everything myself here because of the lack of support from teachers but when I do not understand something I expect  a little help. I get NONE and are told such by many teachers to do not bother them. There are a very FEW good teachers in this school any more. Some of them act like children with their nasty emails. There are absolutely NO trips in my area for my children. Where there use to be atleast 2 a month. My children no longer take lessons so the $200 a year times 2 children we never get. I have suggested putting it into an account and  letting the children get it toward future education or recently how about purchasing Hershey Park tickets for those families that do not use it. Now we get nothing. No hockey game, no baseball game, no Hershey Park. Every time we get a new coordinator in our area they seem to get a swelled head and have trips only they and their children enjoy.The trips in my area are very babyish for my older children. And CCA promotes families to get together for the change in the trips. Families do not bother with each other and teachers make no effort to bother with families so why should any body even try.  I feel CCA has become way too big for themselves and teachers now have too many children in their class rooms just like the B and M schools. It has become more like a business than a family school. We stay with it because we are use to the way the school is on the computer and as I said I do everything here my self, which is fine my children are learning, but when you get these new teachers that come in and want to be big boss and change what we have been doing all these years it does not work. We soooo miss the school we once loved. The teachers we once had who cared, called and got to know. School is a serious thing for children to learn, it is the law and the teachers I have been dealt in the past 3 to 4 years and especially most recent DO NOT CARE.  I  had to change my daughters math teacher at the beginning of the year she called and made my daughter cry so bad. I will not have that. Or an Algebra teacher who told us he didnt want to be bothered helping my son. We went from December 8th to the end of April 2 years ago with out any help while my sons Algebra piled up. Called and called and called just about every day and this is how long he went? Emails go unopened or simply unanswered even from principles and guidance counselors. I did not go to school for this but I am doing the best I can here for my children to succeed. I do not mind no help but can not stand when we send in something wrong and a teacher  sends a nasty email of such who didnt want to help us in the first place. WE MISS OUR OLD CCA.","I am just beginning so I am good so far","I believe everything is great so far\r\n","it already serves me well","Actually check on what the teachers are doing with their time.  One teacher never corrects work on time, ie; write a rough draft.  Finish the remaining classes, get to the final draft and still have o input on the rough draft.  Really.  Very disappointing.  Also, care about the family.  I had an issue.  I contacted the homeroom teacher.  No response.  I emailed the assistant principle, no response.  I emailed the homeroom teacher again and became  very terse in my message.  My response was that he thought that he responded  It is aggravating.","CCA has done a wonderful job serving me and my family.

If it can't be avoided then I feel like children who can do things like math without the longer common core way should NOT be scored lower because they solve problems the traditional way.

We may consider another school for 7th grade if common core is our only choice with CCA next year.","They are doing well, and we have no complaints as of right now.","we are fairly satisfied","I cannot think of anything at this time.","I have not received help with our internet as promised and is a reason I may not re enroll and when a student is behind I feel kids should have a hr with teacher for tutoring maybe been after school hours if need and as well students should get a lot extra credit chances to help grades","find way to help students as get them to encourage them and maybe plan end year gathering for all students and family and for any who pass a grade find something like a certificate congratulating for passing","CCA has served us well.  By continuing to serve us in the same way will be great, and by continuing to make all the students at CCA a number one priority.","Just continue doing as they are.","By having staff be more timely with responses.","I can't think of anything to provide as criticism.

We've loved being a part of CCA","The way that assignments come up within the calendar is somewhat confusing. Because most of the teachers use alternate testing or portfolio assignments it leaves the student waiting for assignments to be signed off. This leaves my student constantly working from behind. I hope this improves with the change to independence.","They can take it easy on those Portfolios way to many for the kids they are giving them all the time you turn around they have one and some of them are long and some kids just don't understand them from what I've been hearing from other kids and parents they need to slow down a little give the kids a break and a chance to play out side not be doing homework all day long.","I am satisfied","don't know","n.a.","At this point there is nothing more CCA can do","Less livelessons.","N/A","I find cca on track with service","I don't think there is anything you can do better.

It seems all the extra activities are so far away from us.","I cannot think of anything","We have always needed help with spelling.  A game or something that view as fun.  We did buy one this year.  I think that Skills for Success hasn't been very helpful over the years.","NA","I'm not sure","CCA is doing a great job.","I think there is too much test prep in 3rd and 4th grade.","Teachers getting after the kids if they are behind in there work.  Sometimes kids are confused or not sure how to do something and they don't get started and then get behind. they are afraid to contact the teacher so the teacher needs to contact them.  I liked when the teacher get then started or even help the kids complete there portfolios.  That is where they get stuck the most.  The portfolios is sometimes very time consuming and confusing. The kids needs more help on getting started on them.  I think if you had the kids interact more like math they would maybe catch on better.  They go to live lessons but until they work a problem out they don't quite understand sometime.  I think they need to do more on the board when it comes to math.  They need something that is fun in math that helps them keep up on there addition, subtraction, and multiplying.","Sometimes I feel that there is too much work for the kids when it comes to the portfolios. There is too many. They always complain about the portfolios, that they are too long, and they always get stuck on them and then they get behind.","doing fine but responding to emails faster","Things are great, but smaller classes would be nice. I think the teachers are stretched thin.","everything is great!","CCA allows my child to learn at his own pace which is a big plus. But at 11th grade I feel he is not prepared for college in that he doesn't meet project deadlines.  When I was in college and high school. If something isn't handed in on time, you got a ZERO - F.  I feel my son pushes the limits on deadlines though he is a very good student, I fear when he gets into college he may just flunk out because he's not been 'trained' to meet deadlines on assignments.  I tell him in the workplace that could easily get you fired.  I think it would have helped starting in 9 -10th grade it would have helped if CCA teachers were more strict in that aspect. If started now - his gpa would be effected and that would make a difference in his college choices at this point.  And end of Jr year the applications with the jr grades go out.  So it's no help now. Personally will have to make this a goal for his sr year.","I would like to see a music class offered. I also would like to have less educational online courses. These can be overwhelming at times. There are also Math courses that are not in the book and they always seem to be the hardest lessons and there are no answers provided to see if you are getting the questions correct.","Not sure.","none","Our son's year has been balanced with one excellent teacher and one very poor teacher. We frequently find mistakes in his lessons (including the math answer key book, which is so bad we've stopped using it entirely), and the Gifted and Talented courses should actually test for giftedness so they aren't bogged down by students who clearly don't belong there. French should be available as a foreign language for elementary school. Japanese would also be a course of interest, and more electives in general.","There aren't enough elective classes available at the middle school level. Our son has already completed Spanish 1 and 2 and is interested in French, but it isn't available until high school. Also, there should be a Music elective available. Prior to this school year, Music was available and our son loved it. We are disappointed that there aren't more electives to choose from.","WE NEED MORE ELECTIVES! Middle school electives are slim and our son has done most of them in his first year of middle school. There won't be any left for next year. We need MUSIC and FRENCH for him as he is very interested in these subjects and plays violin.","my child came into ur program as an IEP student.  He had basic math all through high school, but enrolled in ur program they jumped him into geometry which has algebra and trig in it and is overall a struggle for us. Also, putting him into sign language was a mistake. when I called to have classes changed nothing happened.","Your already doing a great job. The only thing that I can think of, is when that warning thing pops up for him to contact the teacher, it is really hard to get through. He leaves messages, but noone returns a call.","The only thing that I think would make CCA more awesome would be if they could someday offer a Vo-Tech type schooling for kids that would be interested in learning a trade.","I don't know how they can improve they're doing a great job.","nothing right now","No complaints so far","I don't have any specific areas right now.  I would like to see more field trip local to my area.  I realize we are not in a high population area but I would like to see a few field trips come closer.

We seemed to be kept out of the loop and weren't sure what was happening.  Everything is resolved now and the teachers are great but that situation caused a little confusion for a week or two.  It would have been better to have the school administration, principal or homeroom teacher notify the parents and students so we knew why there were emails to that teacher not being returned and lessons not happening but not being cancelled either during that week or two of math. This is truly my only complaint in 3 years with CCA!","Nothing I can think of at this time.","na","make more field offices closer to where students are enrolled","We hope to have a better and more helpful teacher in 5th grade. We are having some learning difficulties and are having difficulties with the teacher and counselor. So, more communication and assistance to help my child with learning. \r\nMy 6th grader has great teacher and excellent help.","Pay closer attention to my son's IEP and how it can work within the CCA environment and be adapted accordingly.","I have no problems at this time.","My son, William needs to be driven by teachers in a live classroom. Also he misses public school terribly and wants to go back to his school.  No fault of CCA, why we aren't returning\r\n","The only complaint I ever had about CCA was that when we started CCA, I submitted grades and courses completed by my children during homeschool.  My oldest is not good at math, to say the least.  He struggles with it, and as such I had to work with him a lot to do his math, and I would say he had a low C high D the year before CCA.  Needless to say, CCA's math is different in several ways than the math we were doing, and all of my children struggles with this adjustment.  My oldest really struggled and failed his first semester of math.  Consequently, they changed the P that I had given him in math to a F.  I understand their reasoning for this, I do not agree.  There has to be another way to handle this sort of situation.  I was very upset.  This went on his transcript and effected his GPA, when I never failed him.  To say he had an F was a lie.  I also felt it was disrespectful of the work we had done prior to CCA.  I asked to just have it taken off, since he was going to have to take that math again, but they couldn't.  I did not fail him.  I am fine that he had a hard time adjusting to the new way they do math, and since he is really not good at math, he just didn't survive the transition and failed.  I am fine that they wanted him to re-do the math he had done with me.  I figured it could only help.  I just felt really insulted that they decided to change my P to an F.  He passed that math with me. \r\n","Help me understand what I need to know to help my son. Computer wise I'm not sure how to do some things. I feel lost sometimes.","More one on one to get my child focused and learning.  When he asks a question to some of the teachers they rush through only giving him a few minutes.  He needs some guidance from the teachers.","There is not a lot of accountability for spelling words.  They are easy to not do because there is so much other work that needs to be done-and on the computer a misspelled word shows up in red and can be easily fixed with spell check (making it easier for the kids...they don't have to look it up in the dictionary).  It is very important that the children learn how to spell. We would like to see more accountability for the spelling words.  Additionally, I would like to see a handwriting book available at the kindergarten and 5th grade (cursive) levels.  (Note: There is one available for 5th grade, but it is on-line.  A physical book would be better)","be a little moer helpful","Cut back on the portfolio items","n/a","I cannot think of anything at the moment. \r\n","I still have a printer to receive that works. My sons lap top is so old I'm waiting for it to stop working any day.","CCA serves us well as a whole. However, the course load is sometimes overwhelming. I feel some courses have an inordinate number of portfolios and it is very hard (and stressful trying) to keep up.","There's really nothing better.","I'm not sure they already do an amazing job","It serves me perfectly as it is","Taking the time with my schedule as a single parent, and spending more time with  my students to better understand the program","The portfolios in the lessons are difficult.","Emails from all teachers about when Live Lessons are going to be.","They are doing everything they can right now","My son doesn't like the way they do the live lessons this year .

There have been a few things that we will be looking at for next year in order to decide if we will continue to remain at CCA. We had 3 different teachers at the beginning of the year and by the 3rd one my daughter thought the teachers were changing because they did not like her, it was our first year and we have twins(in Kindergarten) and it made me feel isolated for the first month. I also reached out for dyslexia review and OT help for my daughter in November, it is now March and although we have had our OT evaluation and notification that Alexia should be having OT weekly, there is nothing set up and there has been no communication at all from CCA. We are going on 4 Months and I still don't have any help, just notification that Alexia needs help and can get it. We hope that next year CCA will be more helpful and smooth.","Service is great as it is. Fast response to emails and phone calls. Fast response to the students needs. Its great the way it is!!","theres nothing","Fix the High school classes! This years change did not offer enough class time or cover the curriculum in a satisfactory way! We had to supplement almost 100% of what our children should be learning in the classroom. This is because the core classes are only offer two main lessons a week! Who can teach an entire; English, Math, Science, or History curriculum in two classes a week? The supplemental offerings are a joke; seeing as they are not interactive, the students can not easily have their questions answered. Furthermore this set up defeats the reason for full time paid having teacher...","We are receiving Special Education for our daughter and when I ask for something new or different in the fall (October-November) it takes until April to get the help we need. It would be nice to receive the help sooner. I end up working all year for help that does not come till the end of the year, thus my daughter does not get the help until the following year. This is the second year that this has happened.","Better communication, more user friendly site, extra attention if a student enrolls in midyear.","I can`t think of anything","n/a","don't know","CCA has been extremely helpful and pleasant and our service has been perfect.","AS PARENTS WE GET BUSY, ON OCCASSION I FORGET TO MARK ATTENDENCE, PLEASE DON'T PUNISH THE STUDENT.  THE KIDS DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO PARENTS LOGIN.  REACH OUT TO THE PARENT, OH AND MINE SAID THAT YOU HAD REACHED OUT TO ME, YOU NEVER CALLED OR EMAILED.","I wish for each week or at the beginning of each month there was an accurate needed materials list.  Sometimes a lesson would randomly require materials we didn't have.  Especially in art.  All the materials lists I could find were either extremely extensive and there was no way I could have went out and bought everything on the list at once, or it was really vague.  Also, the lists weren't broken up into subject or lesson.  That would be helpful.","I do not think they can serve me any better than they already have.","They are doing great. Cant think of anything at the moment.

Just keep it that way.","We've had a pleasant experience so far.  I'm not sure anything could be improved at this point.","satisfied as it is.","You have been wonderful.","More consistent application of policies.  We can do a certain amount of work during most weeks all year and nothing is said, then later in the year we are told we are not doing enough and are given illegal absences.  It seems like some kids are allowed to move at a slower/faster pace with one teacher, but not another.  I would just like to see more specific policies and see them enforced across the board so parents and students can know what to expect.","Understand that not all parents are available for phone calls during the day and allow other forms of communication.","Unfortunately, we live in a rural area in northern Tioga County, and there are not many kids in this area enrolled in CCA. So, our opportunities for social events are not many. The \"Field Trips\" which are planned usually are not very interesting to my boys. We do take advantage of \"Adventure Club\", it seems to have more interesting activities. However, we end up driving up to 2 hours away to join in. There probably isn't anything CCA can do to change this issue, unless CCA was able to have other cyber schools join into social/field trips in our area.","I have abosolutely no complaints about cca there is nothing I can think of for this question","My family lives in Tioga County. The only thing we would like more, would be more opportunities to get together with others. However, we understand that this is because we live in a remote area. We wish for more socializing, but we also understand that it is not easily done because of where we live. \r\n\r\n","If live lessons are optional they should be just that some teachers only make extra credit or certain information available if you attend live lessons I think it should be available to all students regardless","Get common core out","At the start of the year we had a very hard time and having a first year teacher was not helpful no matter how good a teacher.  With this program even though she can work on our schedule and some what her pace, she has to be on the internet most of the time even though I am doing a lot of teaching.  It would be great to have bigger lessons due less often so we could be away from the internet.","Get rid of the Algebra needed to graduate not all people will need Algebra in their future work!","Have no problems!","I wish there was someone to offer more support with PSAT registration, I only received one webmail, and I missed it because my mom was very ill from cancer.

The Williamsport office seems not to offer as many face-to-face opportunities as other places. Field trips are so far away that they are not practical.  Also, often the headings for different lessons vary from what the headings are in the book or in the learning coach's book. It can be very difficult to figure out where you are when they are not coded the same.","Over all I think that CCA serves my family and I very well. The teachers all worked well with me when my work hours changed. I would like to say all the staff does such a great job.","I feel everyone does such a great job already.","i think cca  is doin a great job.","My child has an IEP, all teachers obey the IEP, but some go above and beyond to help my student learn. Ex. Some teachers will allow my child to hand in things that are late, which really helps in my childs situation, and some don't. I wish they would all do the latter and put school about learning the material not just finishing it on a schedule and not letting students do the late work.","There is so much available that it's rather overwhelming at times.  I'd like to know more about utilizing classes that are geared toward my student's interests.  Both boys are very athletic.  Golf, body-building, gymnastics, and rock climbing for a few examples.  What classes would be useful, such as sports management, etc?  Who do I go to for information in guiding their future toward their likes?  The career planning has been somewhat helpful.  They both know exactly what they want, but not sure how to make it a career.  They know their strengths and are both very confident in goal setting.","I wish that CCA could do away with Common Core, though I do know that is not an option.  I really have no complaints.   CCA has been wonderful for us.   I tend to work really long/unusual hours and CCA allows us to work around that.","Some of the lessons (Science) if you use the on-line version of the book you cannot move the side bar down to read the entire page/or have the screen reader read it.   I would also like to see more Tim and Moby videos since my daughter responses well to those.   Because some in our home work \"overnight or late\" scheduled phone calls would be nice like we had in the lower grades instead of random ones.  It makes planning the day much easier and that way we could make sure we're home when the call is to come in.","The classes are very hard for my son. The only person in cca who has kept touch and tried to help over the last 2 years is April Trego. I want to shoutout to her for caring about my son and I as we are going through difficult times. Sam is an iep and has struggled with depression. April is really the only reason I don't completely homeschool. Like traditional schools it seems iep students are left behind. Lucky though my son being in this type of school isn't very affected.","Not sure, I haven't had issues that I didn't speak up about and have handled by CCA very quickly.","CCA overall serves my family well, but I would like to see more seminars and events geared towards college preparation and the college application process.","My son has felt that this yr has been extremely difficult. Although it's nice to have several options for LL( class room time) , having different teachers teach then grade the work is hard. He hates it! Some teachers are just better then others. Also, teachers seem over loaded with amt of students and don't return emails or phone calls back in a timely manner.( last yr his math teacher was MIA most of the yr and even after leaving phone messages and emails wouldn't return calls for weeks! This is MATH! It's hard and I expected her to be available! And his grades showed her careless attitude! )Seems like every yr he has multi of teachers leaving for maternity leave in the middle of the yr. I understand that they need their time off BUT it is extreme disruptive to his learning to be switch back and forth between teachers.  The lack if consistency is  one of the reasons we have not decided on CCA for next yr yet. The other is the amt of unnecessary work that is required and the difficulty of the  curriculum  that makes me want to pull him out and put him into reg public school.  When we started 4 yr ago, there was definitely more involvement between teacher/students.  Most all his teachers he has never talk to on the phone.  His homeroom teacher has been amazing this yr. We are so thankful for him.","We are coming to the end of our 6th year with CCA.  The only thing we did not care for this year is the abundance of teachers and availability of classes to attend.  I understand it was supposed to be beneficial to those who could not attend a scheduled class.  (This is why I love CCA so much though.)  Even though it gave more flexibility to students, it was, at first, somewhat confusing instead of helpful.","I feel that it shouldn't be my child's responsibility to contact teachers or they will go into alarm.  Yes, I think that teacher contact is important, but that the teachers should be calling them, not the other way around.  Unless of course, if the child has a question or needs help then the child should call the teacher.","No issues","I can't think of anything at this time.","overall we are very pleased. The IEP we carried over was not really necessary and not sure were even using it?  It did cause a delay in registering and no one from that department ever made contact with us after at least 5 phone calls.  We ended up going thru the school counselor who helped a lot.   I'm just bringing this up so I hope other families don't run into the same situation.","NA","Disappointing field trip program the last two years.\r\nWhere are the art and music opportunities?\r\nOur city has a symphonies, art museums, art and music academies.\r\nWhat we get offered are trips behind the scenes at Pizza Hut?\r\nWe have been locked out if 90 percent of the field trips we have tried to attend.\r\n\r\nSecond. It would be very effective to facilitate meetings with groups of kids who live close to one another.  A small group class/ activity/ field trip.","We have two very minor complaints, one was that he was not challenged enough in math this year, which is probably a function of him and not a broader issue.  He liked the class and the teacher, but was a bit bored.  The other was more of a structural issue of any online or home learning environment, and that is a lack of daily direct social interactions, which we feel our son needs.  So how can you help here?  I would say in math, have some extra credit and more difficult projects that are optional would be one simple one.  In social, hard to say; you have the field trips, but beyond that I don't know.","Everything is great","I would like to see more AP science programs (Biology, Chemistry, Physics &amp; Maths) for the high school students as right now I don't see much options for my child in the future.","keep up the great job :)","This is our first year with CCA. I do not have any suggestions on how to better serve the students and parents. So far, the staff, including administrators, teachers, support staff and event field trip coordinators have provided excellent service to our family.","I think CCA could improve by updating text books and answer keys to the parents. There were many times while working in the Mathematics text book we could not match up the pages, pages were missing or the online slide courses did not match the learning coaches book. We did submit this information to teachers and were help however, this can be frustrating and could make a parent and student feel they are missing out on their education.","I'm not sure of that answer due to the fact that I'm highly satisfied with CCA.","Perhaps, CCA could take another look at it's new filed trip policy. Last year, my kinesthetic learner and I attended over 30 trips and were thrilled, but this year we are limited to choose only free trips and one paid trip. If given the option to attend more trips, we would not mind paying at all. Our many field trip posts on facebook last year actually provided CCA with a few new students. We do not attend CCA for the trips, but they really do add to my son's experience and social education. Please consider a change?

My daughter began in fourth grade after being home schooled from age four.  The first year posed challenges, but only from a getting acquainted with a totally different education format.  The second year she was challenged more academically and I appreciated that.  This year, while she has two gifted and talented classes, the curriculum does not seem as challenging.  I understand that teachers have a lot of work/students, but I feel like she needs to be challenged more academically.

The slide indicator for each of the areas questioned, didn't work with my computer, but only let me choose \"5.\"  Why? I have no idea.  CCA's biggest liability is its own website and computer technology.  I've spent countless hours working through tech issues. Add to that, teachers don't use the site as intended. For example, the \"planner\" that you're supposed to update, but teachers tell you to ignore it and read all their emails instead to know where they are in the curriculum. Then there's the volumes of mindless emails that you have to read through. It's like being spammed daily about every little detail of school life for K-12th. Then the lesson titles don't always match the grade book titles, which makes it difficult in tracking grades in lessons.  Then there's the filter software that doesn't work with everything CCA has.

In the past, they have been a very important part of socialization for my daughter.  We would have done more of the free ones like PE days just for the socialization, but there weren't that many available.  Also, many of the field trips didn't fill up, but we couldn't even pay to go to them ourselves, and then some end up being cancelled because of lack of interest.  Also, my daughter enjoys the ones that are more physical, so often our choice for the paid trip was SOC, but I would have liked her to be able to participate in more of the education ones.","I would like field trips to be egg free as well as peanut free.","cant think of a thing.","I believe CCA was a good move for our family when transitioning from public school, but it will not, ultimately, be a good fit for our family.

Ours get slower every year.","unsure","I wish the school would offer more social/learning centers at the offices, allowing some group teaching time in person.","Continue to make improvements on curriculum.  Offer plenty of field trips.  Keep up the options of paying for printing costs and private music lessons.","I am unsure how to answer, enjoying what we have now... However, did enjoy the back to school picnics at the beginning of a school year. It really got the children excited to start the year off right. Not to mention it was great to meet some teachers. Maybe that would be my only suggestion, at the start of the school year a day where students could meet their teacher face to face.","Better communication with the parent, the teachers are great at communicating with her, but since I work during the day.  I feel out of touch, and my daughter keeps falling further and further behind.  This previous cyber school had meetings with us both, to make sure she was where she needed to be.  This does not happen here.","Not sure","n/a","Better communication, I feel like I am repeating myself over and over.  My daughter is working and it is not showing up on my screen!","I think CCA has been wonderful.  The communication has been great.  We did have to find and hire a pre calc tutor for our student outside of the CCA program because the tutorials are not enough.","CCA could better serve my family by providing more through descriptions on the courses. Also, a directory to teachers' phone numbers and which courses they teach would be helpful.","Non applicable","I think CCA is doing a great job. Can't really think of anything.","Better equipment\r\nBetter access for the Learning Coach to print quiz's and test for the student to study and \r\nhave access to the answer key.","We understand the complexity of scheduling social/educational events however we feel our daughter received an excellent education grades K-8 at CCA but for her High School years she's asked to experience 'real life' at a brick school.  She's looking forward to some of the social/educational opportunities of being in a class.","My children are in 1st and 3rd grade.  Their teachers have Livelessons for Language Arts and Math but nothing for Science and Social Studies.  I feel that in 2nd and 3rd grade, the test become very intense and cover a lot of information.   I don't know how to prepare them for their tests because I don't know what to expect in the tests.  I feel that breaking it up more and not covering so much in the unit tests would be better.  Because so much is covered it might be beneficial for the teachers to do a review lesson at the end of units.  I know the teachers have a lot on their plates and they do wonderfully.  I just feel this is an area that I am not fully prepared to train the students for success.","CCA can better serve our needs by having their teachers available later in the day. My daughter works during the day and does her schooling later in the evening. Sometimes it could be around 7pm and she would need some help from her teachers. But since most of them are only available until 3, she may not get the answers she needs.","Teacher communication this year has been the worst we have experienced in our 5 years at CCA.  We have had 1 phone call from our L.A. and 1 call from homeroom/science teacher since Nov.  Considering that my son has an IEP and we haven't heard from his learning support teacher is a MAJOR concern!  Overall, we love CCA.  But, if this was our first year, it would've probably been the last year because of communication.","Better, more timely, communication with some teachers would be greatly helpful.","I have recommended multiple people to CCA.  One fallout however has been that as they search for CCA, they are confused by the new signage and actually enroll in the Connections Education program.  Though I was happy with the experience as Connections, I feel they are missing out on some nice opportunities due to the the confusion over the name chage this past year.  I know that with time this will not be an issue, but it is for now.\r\n\r\nI like the variety of field trips that are offered.  However on the classes side, I would like to see an option for instrumental(band)/music/choral, that would allow students to get together, in a classroom setting, not online.  Although online is great, there are some things that make the experience much better when it is direct and hands on.  A weekly, biweekly, or monthly program to join students, with the goal of a final performance.  This gives them something to strive for as they practice, alone and together.",null,"I, personally, am a techno dinosaur! Thank you for making the parent portal easy! Whatever the tech group can think of,keep up the great work!","In my opinion CCA does a great job in almost everything.","I would like to see a course that teaches our students how to get the best out of their CCA experience...one that shows note-taking, classroom/session interaction, &amp; things like that.  How to take notes, study, and prepare is something that our kids lack.","CCA can better server my family by continuing to keep the communication open between staff and learning coaches and  continuing to work together to meet  my students' needs.","It thought our experience was great.","They are great the way they are","There I nothing more they can do..im extremely impressed and satisfied.","be more patience with my child for he is really shy around new people","I am satisfied with the service provided","This is our fourth year with CCA and I am upset to say it is not the same school we started with 4 years ago.  The overall attitude of teachers and staff has changed.  At one time everyone was excited and enthusiastic,not so much anymore.  I have one student who I feel is not being challenged with daily subjects.  She is a fast learner and hearing a lesson once she understands the concept.  Her Kindergarten teacher said she was advanced and she said she would be very surprised if she didn't start 2nd grade curriculum in 1st grade.  The following 2 years of first and 2nd grade the teachers had little or no suggestions as to how to challenge her more, instead basically said be glad she is at or above grade level.  So I question myself as to where she could be or what she could have learned in those 2 years if she was challenged or even advanced a grade.  So overall designing a course of study for each student(like advertised) did not happen for my child.\r\n\r\nMy second area of concern is Field Trips.  I think it is a huge disadvantage to the students to have these regional field trip employees planning events for a huge area.  When we started the Family Mentor planned local and really simple trips that were meant to be social for the students.  I agree adding more educational aspects is a good idea however the main purpose or need for field trips is social experiences.  Some of our favorite trips were local ones at a pizzeria and farmers markets.  In these types of trips the students learned about community and how different people and businesses make up a community which in my opinion is as important as any educational trip that is offered now.  Another huge issue with field trips is in my county and our neighboring county there were 0 field trips the entire year.  Huge disappointment for my children and myself.","Nothing","Its perfect how it is.","Not sure","Helping my student.","provide better math books","not sure","The service is sufficient","The only complaint we have is with the equipment given to the students.

Since we are only able to choose one paid field trip per month, it forced us to choose between two really good options.  We would have happily paid full price for a second or even third field trip.  I live in the south central region, and the better field trips were usually an hour or more away.

There have been a few teachers we weren't thrilled with (which would be in any school setting), but overall, we've had the BEST teachers and BEST experience! I thank you for all the hard work the teachers put into their jobs -- I know it can be quite challenging with some of the students/parents that do not put efforts into their work.

However, he isn't getting caught up in his work and not seeing any light at the end of the tunnel right now.",null,"none","Just keep doing what you're doing!","Unsure at this point","Better curriculum would be a huge plus. Fewer portfolios would be great. Certain teachers need to be better monitored as we've had issues with not enough live lessons or live lessons that are frequently cancelled in a high level, tough course. That's not acceptable to me. Certain teachers in the high school seem like they're on their own with little to no oversight. These same teachers also take quite some time before grading assignments.","The following are the \"weaknesses\" of CCA\r\n*The Spanish Curriculum is based to strongly on culture and not enough on learning the language.\r\n*The curriculum moves to fast in Science and Math.  It does not give the students enough time to totally grasp the material before they are moving on to the next lesson or unit.  (Some teachers have adjusted the curriculum which have really appreciated.)\r\n*In high school, Live Lessons should be taught more frequently for Science as it is for Math and Language Arts.  Science is challenging in high school and deserve to have further explanation from your stellar faculty.  I realize (from my son) that many students complain about the length or frequency of Live Lessons but these kids only have one shot at high school and deserve to have the best chance at understanding these concepts that we can give them.\r\n*The last thing I think could be improved upon is it sometimes feels that students are being \"taught to test\" rather than taught to learn.  I notice this in the curriculum not the Live Lessons or teachers.  It is a weakness of the curriculum.  It seems disjointed or material is missing to give a more complete understanding of the lesson.","We used to love CCA, however, the last couple of school years, the school has taken a steep decline in support and services.  All 4 of our children have been enrolled in CCA, one has graduated, one has dropped out, and the two youngest just aren't receiving the support they need as they both have IEP's.","I have a 3rd and 4th grader, a lot of times they are learning the same thing in Language Arts or Science, just on a different level and at a different time (meaning the units don't line up).  I wish there was a way, I could teach them at the same time instead of 2 different lessons.  I'm not sure if it is possible.\r\n\r\nI tried to do it on my own last year and it didn't work out too well.","It is a benefit having a teacher located in the Harrisburg office near us that we can visit on a regular basis.  In previous years, there appear to have been more field trips located at the CCA office than there have been this year.  We really found great benefit going to the teacher activity days at the office in the past.  Perhaps in the future, more trips could be planned for the CCA buildings.  It has been a great learning experience to go on field trips related to what our child is studying at the time.  The field trips coordinators (Brittany and Thelma) have done a great job setting up educational trips during the school year which directly apply to the curriculum and we hope that this will continue in the future.","Im happy.","The mentors are pretty non-existent.  During the orientation, they mentioned how the mentors are there for you and always check in to make sure things are going well.  I think that I heard from my mentor, maybe once, and that was it.","Overall, CCA is a wonderful school.  There are certain aspects of the curriculum that aren't perfect.  I know this is a work in progress.  My family has truly had a wonderful experience with the school and have recommended the school to others.","Have more responsive teachers, allow students to do vo tech classes","Can't think of anything at the present time.","Help deciding best classes to take to prepare for college","It would nice if it could be offered state to state.","There are still too many portfolios, even though that has improved over the past couple years. There is absolutely no need whatsoever to have that many portfolios submitted. There should be no more than ONE portfolio per subject per semester expected. Anything more than that is just plain burdensome and doesn't accomplish its intended purpose anyway. Quite honestly, my true opinion is ANY portfolio beyond 3rd grade (where actually seeing a student's handwriting is necessary) is completely unnecessary and impractical. \r\n\r\n PLEASE develop better curriculum. It has been my number one complaint for years and has driven me to research other schooling options every single year. This curriculum is outdated, boring, moves WAY too fast, and is unimaginative. My student is bored out of his mind (not because he's overly intelligent, but just because the content is presented in such a boring way) and every year, I think of so many ways that I could create a more fulfilling and fun learning experience for him. \r\n\r\nLive lessons are WAY too long in many classes.  Both my students have live lessons that are nearly an hour or often OVER an hour long! No one should have to stare at a tiny picture of a teacher going on and on and on for an hour plus. That wouldn't hold ANYONE'S attention. These overly long live lessons have led us to skip the lessons completely in all but two classes, which is a shame.","Only complaint is the \"overdue lesson list.\"  It is apparently not always accurate.  It has caused family arguments because we think our student is x number of lessons behind, only to find out some were eliminated or rescheduled so they were not due yet.  It would be very helpful if this list was more accurate.

I will never stop assisting my child understand something. It doesn't matter if he is on the phone with her or not.

It is very hard to get in touch them. In brick and mortar schools the counselor knows what you need for graduation and what you can take. At CCA I got \"talk to her English teacher, they might know better if she can take it\". I still haven't heard back from my sophomore's counselor.

James is my second child to enroll in CCA. Next year will be James' last year in school then we are simply not sure where we are going from there. This has nothing to do with the education he received but rather health and other personal issues we are facing.","Have the teachers remember, that there are IEP students in regular classes, mixed in with students \"without IEP'S\".  Sometimes the teachers move a little to fast, for the student with the IEP.","They are being incredible. We just need for her to be able to access school 24/7/ 365, and be able to proceed and go through things at her pace, (sometimes straight through);  as her body, mind and meds allow. The fact that some of the teachers are willing to work with her 1 on 1 at the center is fantastic if we can just get her there.","Not sure","CCA has done everything to meet our standards.  CCA teachers are the most competent teachers I have see in quite a few years.","CCA is doing all it can do.","I wished there was a class that goes a little bit slower with math.  My child takes in math at a slow rate.  It is hard for him.  Although the teacher is fantastic, he goes fast for my child.  He has a very enjoyable personality, for sure.  I think much of it is the curriculum itself.  For years my child has been in cyber schools &amp; for years I have seen his content.  The content in math spends very little time with basic math, and the math that we use in everyday life.  Instead too much time is spent with stuff unlikely to be used in everyday life.  I realize, the intellectual type of people will make claims that we use algebra, geometry, etc all the time.  However, I have not yet heard of a instance that is realistic.  And the situations I hear making the claims are very weak situations. (Finding the volume of a rectangular prism....c'mon, we all do this when we take care of the leftovers from the supper table...we don't need a formula for this) (Changing a recipe from a lb of chicken to oz. ........we have done this for years....conversion table)  I am not saying we shouldn't have this kind of content, but not so much of it that the grade becomes effected by it.  More emphasis should be on basic stuff.  My generation has great math skills and it is because of the time spent on learning them.  These are also needed to proceed to the other stuff.  Multiplication takes some serious time to fully take in.  It seems the schools today do not want that time to be taken fully.  And I don't care what anyone says, multiplying, division, adding and subtraction are much more important then algebraic puzzles.  These do not fit every day life.  Nor does geometry unless you plan on getting into certain fields.  Too much emphasis is spent on these things.  Although I learned a couple things myself with the common core strategies....overall, I think they are a horrible curriculum to be teaching.  It takes a person all the way around the mulberry bush to get a simple answer.  It leaves my kid in tears, telling me he is stupid and can't do it.  And I know my kid is not stupid.  He may be a bit slower in learning math, but stupid is not a word for him, for sure.  I have always been good at math and some of the stuff I have seen being taught to him....I have no idea what the curriculum is doing.  I do believe it explains why my son has such a hard time in math.  I think there should be a alternative math class that teaches the basics in full for elementary kids.  And the same class leaves out so much time for unnecessary things like algebra.  There is nothing in this world that basic math will not answer.  Learning how to balance a checkbook could be a good replacement.  I realize this will go no place.  But I definitely had to get my opinion in.  I feel bad for the kids going through the curriculum of today.  If it was not in every school, I would definitely seek out schools that did not get into common core 'cuz taking common core out would be a real plus.\r\nI also think it would be good to have a \"recess\" class for kids to hang out in.  It would help with the social aspect in my opinion.  Yes, there are outings.  Where I live, it is unfeasible to get the daily stuff in and attend.  They are too far away for us.  I also wished the pssa's were a bit closer as well.  I work nights and am usually so tired to be driving like I have been to get to these pssa meeting places.","prefer other theories besides evolution be shared and evolution be shared as the theory it is not as a fact which it is not","teach evolution as a theory because it is not a fact, and teach other theories as well,","I feel Some teachers do not pour into the kids as much as they should.","n/a","There is one teacher in particular that does not grade things promptly. Even after my child has asked her to, and even I have encouraged her to do so, she still lets grading get behind by units. This is highly frustrating when my child's grade is suffering from one particular assignment, but when he does well on the following assignments to raise his grade, there is no reflection for weeks until the teacher is reminded to grade them. My child likes to go back through recently visited assignments to reflect on the things he needs to work on, and it is hard for him to do that when a whole units and several lessons have passed until the teacher grades the assignment. She is constantly absent, and maybe that is why the grades are falling behind. It is just frustrating when my child is focused on doing well, and is trying to participate in sports at the local school, and is WAITING for assignments to be graded because they have a poor reflection on him being able to participate. Our math teacher last year was awesome, but this year's math teacher is not a good reflection of what CCA has come to mean to me and my family.","WE tend to do our schooling later in the day, it would be helpful to be able to watch the LL on our schedual ...

Perhaps some sort of tracking on how long a response takes.  According to CCA teachers have 24 hours during the week to respond.  I don't expect that.  I do however expect a response within a couple days.  I have had multiple issues where I have sent multiple e-mails and never received a response.  To me that is unacceptable.

The reason I selected CCA vs traditional home schooling was for the support.  Without communication from the teacher, or at very least an answer to e-mails asking questions, the reason for selecting CCA is void.  I think I would rather go at this alone, than with a support system that isn't there.","We are concerned about wording errors on Connexus tests.  It is my understanding that a third party creates these tests.  I am sure CCA teachers have reviewed them but we are still finding wording errors.  \r\nAlso, I agree with CCA that portolios are important but too many can be overkill.  I would not recommend this school to others because the workload is so heavy.","I wish that there were more educational and social events for the high school students and that they were not too far away from our area.

During this time he received none of his CCA LST supports.

It is now April and NO ONE, including Mrs. Manning has been able to answer this question.  Then to find out that Mrs Hoffman who wrote his IEP without ever even meeting him and who I also asked about his placement is the one that does the testing is very disheartening.

I have repeatedly reported the in home BCBAs to CCA (for both my boys) as not assessing, creating, implementing, or communicating a plan/program with the IEP team.  There has been no recourse.

There is inadequate differentiation and true enrichment for young students. Though we will accelerate him to second grade early, he is too young chronologically to do that in a brick-and-mortar school. If he needs to transfer into one, he will be dramatically younger than his peers. He was already on the very young end of the spectrum for his grade. This was a problem with our daughter too - she accelerated a grade as well. Ultimately we withdrew her midway through 3rd grade because she was on her FIFTH teacher in 6 months. We also really burned out on the relentless test prep. I felt that the social studies content was repetitive year after year, too. We are generally pleased with CCA - that's why we've enrolled our son - I just hope that we don't have any more rapidly changing teacher issues, and I hope that test prep doesn't take over. I am a public school teacher and I understand the desperation for test scores, but there has to be more to school. Thanks so much for all you do!","I haven't give it much thought yet","Offer transportation for students in the southern portion of the state.  Also, it would be great if a student was having difficulty with a lesson, he should be able to complete other assignments and continue to work on that particular subject and come back to the lesson when he is more comfortable with it.  For example, he (my son) was having problems building his confidence enough to do a speech in literature and was falling further and further behind in English.  Unable to move forward, he eventually skipped the speech, accepted a zero and dropped his overall grade in that subject ten points (from an A to a B).  He was too insecure to talk to his teacher about the problems he was having.","n/a","My child has been with CCA since 3rd grade, now an honors junior.

This has happened several times this past year.  The contact number for another teacher is a fax number, which is frustrating. Just very inadequate this year from previous years.  I still think the teachers and staff are great, maybe just more students than they can handle?","You've done a great job","The special education teacher was non attentive ,she never communicated with my student.

The voices are often garbled, scratchy and just in general, hard to listen to. In the event that a teacher is actual clear, then it always seems that there is so much background noise, complete with other teachers doing LL, that it is hard for me as an adult to focus on just that one voice. With LL being so important in a virtual school, I am beyond disappointed that CCA accepts such low quality. The teachers are so amazing and have so many valuable things to say, it is very unfortunate that it is so hard for the students to actually understand them. Add into that equation, a student with ADHD and/or sensory issues and it is a complete disaster. I wish CCA would get teachers some quality headphones and have a more private area for them to hold their LL.","Have more field trips closer to our area.  Have LL for all classes.","N/A","not sure, I have no complaints.","Prepare her for the transition to a 4 year school","I would prefer that the programs be set up where students must achieve a C or better in order to complete the course and submit it to their teachers. This way if they don't understand the first time around they have the opportunity to do it over and over until they do understand it and their learning can increase instead of just completing the course with any grade and just obtain extra credit to help increase their grades and not truly understand what the course was about.","NA","you guys do good nothing needs better","NOTHING REALLY JUST WISH THERE WAS MORE TRIPS AND PSSA CLOSER TO US LIKE AROUND THE CHAMBERSBURG AREA","I honestly cannot think of anything.","Better live lesson curriculum.  Return the high school format back to what it was prior to 2016/17 school year.  Cut back on number of tests with every lesson.","I think CCA is doing a really good job already.","It is already good.","I am thinking of enrolling another child for the 2016-17 school year. I've noticed from K - 2nd grade a lot of material was repeated from previous years. I've only ever had one student enrolled at CCA.  So, I'm not sure if this is currently being done or not. But I was wondering if it's possible to have that repeated material line up so both of my sons are learning the same material just at different levels. I think this would not only be helpful for the learning coaches, but the students as well. They will be able to lean not only on the coach but each other for support.","Not sure if there is a way to set up something similar to the Co-op some home school students use.","The tests and quick checks are horrible.  At least once a day I find a question that amounts to a trick question just because of wording.  just ask straight forward questions.  Also, English tests are ridiculous this year.  A closed book and an open book test??? Are you kidding me.  Here's a novel idea, just put the 2 together.  Do you have any idea how hard it is to get your child to do a second test on the same stuff she just did a 25 question test???  Obviously not because it's in the curriculum.","better special education teachers","Have his general education teacher be more pro active with modifications. I feel I have to harass the teacher to get work graded and modifications given","Either get rid of portfolio's or at least lessen them, and absolutely positively get rid of the discussions.  When I check my kids discussions, all I see in responses is \"I agree\".  They are useless.  I'm sure that it makes someone feel really good that they made up this totally subjective question on how you feel about a certain situation, but in all honesty, how do you grade something on how someone feels.  It's not right or wrong on how they feel, that's how they feel.  So you waste 30 minutes of learning time putting your feelings down on paper and you get a 10/10.  As for portfolio's, we've done portfolios following the instructions only to fail them because the instructions were modified by the teacher.  It's particularly disheartening when they say you would have passed if we were doing it the way the instructions were listed but they were changed.  We enrolled in CCA because our kids are professional athletes, it was a good program at one time, but it has steadily gone downhill.  There's an old saying that \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\", so please stop trying to fix it.  I can tell my learning coach day is going to hell in a hand basket when I open my webmail and it tells me I have a video message from Dr. Flurie on new exciting things coming to CCA.  I just walk away with that I'm screwed feeling.","Not sure","My only complaint are the frowny faces on the homepage dashboard. My children are introverts and do not willingly reach out to teachers to chat on the phone. So having them listed as \"in alarm\" status is very disconcerting given that they are both good students.","No specific ideas at this time.","I would like some of the books to be updated.  I would like webcams provided for all children.","Consistent quality of programs.  The computer science coursework has been very disappointing.  Took a kid who loved programming and computers and made him not want to study it anymore.  It is not rigor -- he has a nearly perfect grade -- it is the lack of responsiveness from the teacher, the repetitiveness of the material, the way that the teacher is disengaged from the material.  He says it seems like the curriculum is totally independent from the teacher.  Like someone created an online course and put the teacher in charge, but the teacher is not connected to the material at all. \r\n\r\nWe chose this curriculum for the flexibility of the program.  With more HS teachers requiring live lesson attendance, this has impacted his ability to attend music lessons and band.","I  can't think of anything right now.","I think the special education department could do a better job in being more \"on top\" of getting evaluations completed and therapies started. I had a therapist request a physical therapy evaluation last year and have yet to hear anything about that happening. It's definitely been past the 60 day mark since she requested that via email to CCA. My other child had a neuropsychologist evaluation stating medical need for certain therapies at the start of the 2016-2017 school year, and services for her hadn't started until about a month ago. I feel like that process could have been completed sooner.","There needs to be better monitoring and accountability for students' emails.  The fact the students can email each other, delete the email and there is no way to track it is not safe and I have to monitor my daughter very closely because of that.  Either administration is unaware of how students are using their webmail system or they wish to ignore the seriousness of it because of the cost and time that would go into making the necessary changes. It is something that CCA should take very seriously and correct this issue immediately.","I am happy with CCA!\r\n","Are there other curriculum options available 7n case a particular way of lwarning does not work with an individual?","Better administrative communication often no calls back better parent teacher communication. And more local field trips and events in York PA ( our local area. ) Often the seminar s and events - field trips are few and far between. For that area. And the ones that do happen a  a couple hrs drive away Thus not getting alot of class interaction. And being a only child this is extremely IMPORTANT.cant stress that enough.","I am satisfied with CCA","There is some frustration with a very few teachers who take a long time to enter grades. Also, with attendance at live lessons  and phone calls not being credited toward the student interacting with their teachers (that approaching alarm status message every 2 weeks when calls etc have been done during that time has gotten really old).  The length of time it takes for the alarm status to update when teachers are called again to get it rectified.","Our family is very pleased with CCA as it is.  We will be seeking more detailed transition planning as my learning support student prepares for graduation; however, I am certain that it will be provided when we ask.","At the moment, I don't think there is any way CCA can better serve me. They do an awesome job now.","not as much contact with teacher. let me teach.","Keep doing what they are doing.","N/a","n/a","NA","I would prefer the traditional grading system where grades are not a year long grade.","Less phone calls from teachers. We stay in contact with the homeroom teacher enough. Don't feel that others need to contact.","I had a daughter who was enrolled in CCA 4 years ago so I am not new to the school but when I signed my second child up we ran into a lot more technical glitches this time, at first I was not able to log in as a learning coach for about 3 weeks, it took about 5 phone calls until I got that resolved, then signing up for Khan Academy for one of my daughter's classes required about 4 phone calls and several weeks to get straightened out, then the battery didn't work from the start on the laptop so we had to call and get another one shipped, then one of the textbooks was missing so we called and had that shipped out, after that we had 2 computer's that the hard drives went out in and my daughter lost all of her work that she was working on at the time, so we had to pack each one of those up, print out labels, ship those back and wait for new ones to be shipped, 2 times now I have received an approaching alarm status for my daughter not going to a live lessons or communicating with her teachers when I have personally seen her logged into live lessons and have seen the emails that she was sending to her teachers for those particular weeks and right now I am trying to fill out my daughter's \"intent to return\" form but after I enter my name, email address and household pin it tells me \"invalid information\" but all of my info is correct so I am going to have to call again and find out why it won't let me log in to complete the form, It get s a little frustrating when you have to get on the phone and call and wait to get all of these thing straightened out, I realize things happen, I just never had these many issues 4 years ago.","more communication","Help keep students motivated. And help me keep my student motivated","n/a","I am very pleased with the school.","n/a","stop the surveys and all this other communication via email","I am completely satisfied with CCA.","I think CCA is doing a good job overall, the only thing I see improving upon is the ability to have a search that you could look up all aspects of the site. Was trying to look up a teacher with the search box and could not do so. Had to figure out how to find the teacher info. on the parents page but had difficulty. Finally figured it out though. It should be made much easier by just searching.","I would like to see events/programs closer to us rather than Harrisburg.","I wish some of the field trips were closer to us, but it's understandable since PA is a big state.","The only problem we have really had is that twice a week 3 of the live lessons are scheduled at or near the same time and overlap so she has a difficult time choosing which one to attend, then ends up missing all of them by the time she decides.","A little frustrated at lack of communication with teachers/parents regarding the failure of subjects my child is currently taking","I would like to see answers to all posed questions. Not all lessons seem to have answers.\r\nI would also like to have study guides the kids can fill out to use to study. A few of the teachers have them but I don't think all of them do. Often the lesson says to look back over the last few lessons to revise; in practice this is very time consuming and not easy. If we had a simple study guides to fill out it would shorten and make study time more efficient.","The higher grades do not need to change a thing. For the lower elementary grades I feel like it would be more beneficial if live lessons were for every class. My child likes that time with the teacher. So if you could do a 30 min lesson for each class instead of  just for math and language arts that would be wonderful.","Continue everything that you all already do!","Have more PSSA SAT prep during Live Lesson classes","You all have done a very good job","My son will be in the special education program. He is Autistic. I would love to know what learning tools you have in place for children like my son.","unsure","Earlier this year, I reached out by webmail to the high school principal in regard to the change in live lessons.  I told him that it was not a good change because my high-schoolers no longer attend live lessons, when they used to attend nearly all of them.  Even their teachers do not like the change.  He didn't bother to reply to my webmail, he just sent out a school-wide webmail to try to convince everyone that the change has been a huge success.  The whole thing must have been his idea or something, because he wouldn't listen to honest feedback.  I still might try to find a better cyber school for my highschoolers, because I'm still unhappy with the change.","More consistency in grading standards; less cumbersome portfolios; more interactive tutoring sessions as part of the classroom learning experience.","I'm really not sure. I have been happy, my daughter is happy. I only wish Pa. would have allowed my daughter to take college courses while attending high school. She wasn't very challenged in high school. I also wish Pa would address having different levels of classes rather than grouping them into the same curriculum.","By not giving subjects that the student does not really need, like algebra, game design, career planning, computer programming, et cetera.  What happened to the subjects like basic English, math, et cetera.  Only give the subjects that's required to graduate.","I only have one complaint. The art course is lacking very much. Art should be a fun course, kids should be following along while watching a teacher demonstrate art. My child came from a private school where are was her favorite class. Her art was in school auctions and has been displayed. In CCA art class my child does nothing but read and does not see the teacher demonstrating techniques.  I know this teacher is very qualified but my child has lost the love of taking an art class at CCA. I had to enroll her in a art program outside of CCA so that my child may proceed with her love of Art and learning new techniques and watching them being done.  I feel is CCA was to do this, it would be awesome. Also offer art courses to the older kids, for they to have talent and might want to pursue as well.","Webmail could be way better- I have to search for the person I want to contact every time through a drop down menu of EVERY person in the school. I can't create a frequent contact list, etc. The virtual library is atrocious. I am STILL trying to find the school calendar. Older things (like school test results) could be archived. There could be a Hot button for current year information-either in the virtual library or right on my student's or my home page. Running the scheduler in high school seems redundant. The schedule isn't flexible in high school, which is a shame because my son prefers to block lessons (Science on Monday, Math on Tuesday, etc) It is helpful for him to stay focused on one subject matter at a time. After speaking to families enrolled in other cyberschools, it seems CCA is the only one who requires portfolios. I can see writing papers in English, science experiments, but I think this whole process could be re-evaluated. A portfolio assignment in a core class will shut my son down for a week. Meanwhile, other assignments become overdue. Technical issues (which sometimes cannot be avoided, I understand this), however, LL that constantly freeze, or no sound or the recording doesn't match the sound with the slides. I completed a degree online, there are definitely other options that work well and more reliably. Modified assignments are tricky. Special education students have to SEARCH for these. A lot of my son's teachers this year are using Google docs to create their own tests, which I think serves the student better, but, my son, with poor executive functioning doesn't look for these things. It needs to be on his radar so to speak. Overall, finding information is difficult. Consistency is not always present--we have done assignments that came on the planner and when you get to the end---it was dropped, but doesn't show as dropped in the course tree. My son doesn't find career planning to be useful.","There has been a definite decline in responsiveness from staff, especially during the enrollment process and from the Special Education Department in the past year.  I also think CCA needs to provide better services for students that have IEP's.  There is no real remedial Title I services available to students who continue to have reading difficulties in the middle school grades, and even in the elementary grades, it's still lacking.  What exactly is the Title I monies being used for because I don't see it being used to support my student at all.","I cannot think of any improvements.  Please continue to hire the high quality and caring teachers to keep your program strong.","By having a regional parent forum and/or regularly scheduled meet ups. Field trips are nice but you don't usually see the same people often.   A regular meeting for a small area would help younger students and families that prefer real rather than cyber relationships to make lasting friendships.","It would be awesome if you had a parent message board; like a facebook or a forum type thing.  Have it grouped regionally so that parents/learning coaches can get to know each other, discuss school related topics and more easily arrange meet ups for the kids.","none","CCA could have better served by following through last fall on its commitment to the students of Java Programming I.  This course was one of the reasons CCA was more attractive than our local high school.  Now the local school is doubling down on its commitment to computer science, so our continuation with CCA is unsure.\r\n\r\nWhat can't be undone is the poor impression that this leaves with me as both a parent and an educator.  When the email came through with the bad news that Jordann Smith was taking another position within CCA and \"good\" news that the course was ending early with remaining expectations eliminated, this seemed the height of contempt for commitment to academic work.  Not only was CCA not committed, but it communicated to its students via email that less work for the semester was \"good news\".  This was a very poor attitude communicated by the coordinator of your elective courses.\r\n","More group events locally to me","We have had several teachers in just one year. In some subjects my high school student has had 3 teachers in just half a year.\r\nMy son had a teacher we love quit in the middle of the year.\r\nHoping CCA can do better job at retaining teachers.","I would like to have the Learning Coach lesson instructions included below the student lessons.

The teacher who moved my son, had never attended a Sync class. They should. He was later removed from program.  It might be a good program if presented before the start of the year.

Give the kids a chance to get back in the routine.\r\nLESS PORTFOLIO items per subject. \r\n\r\n","The Tech can be better.  There are videos that do not play (K-Hippo, Lion, Ladybug videos) or are outdated (Discovery Website)  My kids get the most out of Brain Pop!

Some teachers do not respond to webmails.\r\nThey grade down on a huge slant. Makes it very frustrating.\r\nTeacher communication needs to be improved. I web mail some of my students teachers and we hardly ever get a response. Not acceptable.","Doing great!  No complaints!","At this point I don't have many complaints.  I think everyone has been so helpful from the first week when I couldn't figure out how to get rolling with the scheduler to the more recent everyday questions.  My kids really love CCA and I have seen them grow and mature in many ways.  I see both of them taking the initiative with their learning and learning to be self-motivated and proactive when they don't quite get the grade they hoped.  In my book these are great things.  I believe true learning is being a self-learner and someday when school books, college books, etc... have all closed, a child keeps learning and exposing themselves to new things.  It's when they don't know how to do something, they figure out a way they can learn it on their own or by taking a class.  These things create a truly enriching educational experience and an adult life filled with new and exciting things.","administration be more available by phone.  Always have to play phone tag","I'm not sure there is anything else CCA can do better. I'm satisfied with CCA already.","The issue is more on our end.  We really need to reach out to teachers more.","All teachers, administrators and staff that I've come into contact with have been extremely helpful.

The only people who benefit from it are the publishers of the school books.","I feel that they are not providing enough field trip in our 17331area. We have to travel a lot miles just to go onto a fieldtrip.","So far so good","The kindergarten curriculum is too rigorous for most 5 year olds with writing/ language arts. The K- Art is too advanced with asking questions about the elements of art and having kids put them in their art and explaining how they used it. My child cries when she sees she has an art portfolio. She just wants to do her art the way she sees it. \r\n","The special ed department, at least at the elementary level is in complete disarray. After repeatedly bringing this to the attention of the elementary administration the issue has still not been taken care of. All our daughter's supplemental education as well as support has come from the home front. We have spent our own money on curriculum to close the educational gap.  How CCA choices to make amends with our daughter's education will dictate our decision going forward with her education.","I feel the high school teachers need to be more involved. I wish they were more like the middle and elementary teachers","CCA is doing a fine job.","By continuing to maintain a good program with various opportunities.  Also, ensuring the teachers and staff are sufficiently trained and pleasant, especially as this is online.","Sometimes my son gets behind in his classes due to Dr visits and therapies.

The program is encouraging students to self pace in the virtual lesson, that is an Honors program not Special Education. My son failed a test because he was a block(unit ahead).  Read180 has rather depressing subjects, child labor, suicide, runaways, immagrants- not a positive text to learn reading skills.

It is not always easy to know where to begin when you have a problem. I also feel it should somehow be worked out that the high school homeroom teacher should be a person who also does not teach a class to a student in that homeroom. If there is a concern about the homeroom teacher, I do not feel comfortable going to someone else and telling them about my concern because human nature, in most cases, would then make the homeroom teacher upset with my child. That could make it more difficult for my child in that class.

Despite having an actual CCA office here, there was not a showing of \"Romeo and Juliette\" movie at this location. All of the other dates/times/locations were a significant distance from our home, which precluded my daughter from participating. I understand there are limitations, especially with extracurricular activities, but this item was specifically related to a curriculum/course requirement and not having the opportunity to view and discuss the film with other students and faculty (who are specifically familiar with the expected student learning outcomes) put my daughter at a significant disadvantage compared to her peers.","Keep up the good work.  I would be nice to have more support for high school students that are interested in early graduation.  I had to fight for my son to graduate early.

I'd love to have something similar to what Apple uses for their calendars, the ability to type an entry and have it appear on specific calendar(s) by clicking on a box. For example, my 2 children have swim lessons at the same time rather than making 1 entry and applying to both calendars; I put it into my household planner which will show up on theirs. However if I type a reminder for my oldest on my planner it will show up on both planners so then I'm going into her planner and putting in a reminder for her but it doesn't show up on my household calendar.\r\n\r\nI'd love to drag and drop subjects into specific time slots so I can have them working on subjects that I think will either help us stay together and organized or subjects that I think will work better at certain times of the day (i.e. not math first :)). They see it in the order it comes up on their planner and feel locked into working in that order. \r\n\r\nGiving the incoming parents the knowledge of a-sync, blended, and sync type teachers before being assigned to classes. We had one a-sync and one blended, we would've preferred having 2 blended teachers. Maybe it's due to being our first year but a blended teacher was a God-send. It was a few wks before I even knew there were different types thereby not understanding why one teacher was \"better\" than the other when in fact both have been great. Now I can see the requirements on their end are different. Once I understood that, everything made sense as to why there was such a difference.","I have had no issues with CCA, it is excellent as far as the learning part goes and you guys offer so much extra that I can't even begin to think of anything else you could be doing.","WE are happy","Have a better system for field trips. Your trips are not all of equal quality. As a working parent I can not always be taking off in the middle of the week for a field trip. If you are going to limit the number of trips a child can attend fine then set a limit but don't limit per month. Some months are easier to take 2 or 3 trip and others I can not fit in any AND when I can fit one there is not always one my kids would want to attend. There are also not enough quality trips in our local area.","My child has an IEP and gets OT.  I would prefer this to be done in person instead of virtually.","You need to revamp your special ed team. The responsiveness is lacking.

These are the years to make kids enjoy learning. The testing, especially in Social Studies, Science, and Art,takes the focus away from concepts and to memorizing soon forgotten facts.  Also, upon talking to several friends that are elementary teachers, they inform me that the writing expectations are beyond what is necessary at these ages.","I think everything is going well right now seeing how we just started the program its going great.","Nothing","I think teachers should communicate with the kids more","We would like to see some agriculture classes as electives there are alot of farming students and it can range frome vet sciences  dairy horticulure forestry the options are numerous","They have served us well they have have excellent teachers and great livelessons teachers are friendly.","all is good thank you","Last yr we could go on as many field trips as we wanted to, This yr we could only go on one few month. Many of the field trips we signed up for were canceled. When trips were canceled it meant that we missed out on a field trip that month cause it was to late to try to sign up for another trip. I understand about the financial side of things being the reason for the only one trip per month, but half of the trips were canceled due to not enough people signing up. If we would have been able to sign up for more than one I don't think the trips would have been canceled.","We are very pleased with the education our children are receiving at CCA.  Keep up the great work!\r\n\r\n","Provide the ink; my daughter in 3rd grade has to print out a lot of paperwork. The cost for the ink, internet, paper, and other school supplies can be overwhelming at times.","Keep doing what you are doing!","keep up the good work","I believe the school and staf did a wonderful job in assisting me with the whole process our first year at CcA. tHe rest of it kind of falls into place.","First of all, a survey that simply has me rating things on a scale is a poor representation of how I find this whole experience. If you have the rating section, you should also have a comments section for the questions so that people can provide reasoning for their ratings. The generic ratings that you are getting do not tell you anything other than to give percentages of people who are satisfied or dissatisfied. You have no idea what people are actually dissatisfied with. Next, I was disappointed to see a webmail go regarding a change in the science requirements again. If you are only going to meet the minimum standard of the state than what is the advantage of having all of my kids home with me all day, everyday? Interpreting literature and poetry seems to be more important to everyone these days than math and science. Then we sit around wondering why we are falling in the world in scientists and engineers. I have become disappointed in the educational system as whole over the years and that change in CCA was disappointing as well.","The special education department, in my experience, has been the most lacking.  Two of our students (now just one) have IEPs, and the communication was few and very far between.  If they had been more dependent on those services, that would have been cause for us to discontinue our relationship with CCA.","The field trips &amp; social events are to far from our home or there are not any for my daughters age group.","The quality of the laptops might be improved.  They are adequate, but there are many times when my children are kicked off of a lesson for no reason, or the sound quality is poor.  The quality is OK, but since this is a cyber school, ideally, the quality of the laptop and technology should be excellent.","My younger daughter failed the algebra keystone the first time she took it.  After working intensively with her for 3+ months, she scored an advance the second time.  I have some thoughts to share about what might help other students, but I will address them in a separate (longer) email.  \r\n\r\nMy older daughter was not accepted into the National Honor Society, although she had a GPA of 97% and an excellent letter of recommendation.  Her essay was a little weak, probably owing to the fact that she had no idea what direction she wanted to go in career-wise (that has changed).  She was also told that she did not do enough volunteer work.  I felt that this was unfair.  We don't belong to Girl Scouts because we are not Christians.  Without something like that, it isn't easy to find volunteer work for a child, especially with the new requirements for clearances.  With great difficulty, I found something for her.  She continues to maintain her GPA, and I sincerely hope she will be accepted next time as it will be her senior year.  I would ask you to review the criteria for selection.  I know she would have been easily accepted were she still in our local brick and mortar school.","Probably the best way that CCA can better serve me is by people answering my e-mails in a timely manner. Some of my e-mails don't even get answered. Not sure why.","I am already pleased with the program and if I had an issue I would tell you immediately.","I have nothing at this time.","I can't think of anything right now.","I think the mentor's should do a much better job, especially for a first year family. And staff could return calls faster.","The only things that disturb me about CCA and really I guess it isn't CCA'S fought but, doing away with the school's picnics I feel that the children work very hard during the school year and they deserve to go somewhere like Hershey or Knoebels Park which was a great place to go and enjoy with other students and teachers. Then, the second thing that always concerns me is why do the students have to travel to places for their PSSA's when all other work is done online? I have to travel for hrs. to get to the site that is having the PSSA's then you have to wait around for hrs. until they are done when I feel that the school should try and accommodate the families with a lounge area and some food or snacks while waiting for the student to get done. It is absurd for me to travel home and then come back out to pick up my student with the miles that I have to run. This is a concern not only for me but I had talked to a lot of parents and they feel the same as I do. Maybe in the future you might accommodate the parents as well. THank you.","Remove political agendas from curriculum and test children so they can work at their level in all subjects instead of blanket curriculum based on age.","I am very happy with the very good educational plan , the teachers have been wonderful, tech support is awesome and we love all our great Field trips. \r\nI do have one Big concern, I would like to see a BIG drop in the recent rise in Portfolios. We have almost 4x the portfolios in the second half of this year. Because of this huge rise, we are not enjoying the CCA experience as much, we can only worry about all the portfolios that need to be done. More stressful than fun or having a fun time learning. I was totally comfortable with the amount of portfolios for the previous year and the beginning of this year. This has really made my job as a learning coach with 2 small children a huge jump in time and more frustration for me and my kids. I know I am not the only one that feels this way , and would like to see more thought put into the lesson plans and what can actually be accomplished. I hope this opinion finds its way to an action that helps everyone.","At this time....cant think of anything.","I really can't think of anything right now....I am very happy with what CCA does now ......KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK","Allowing students to work through portfolios so they do not fall far behind in their work","I am very happy with all that they do for me now!","Sometimes be more clear about assignments.","I am very satisfied with the serve I currently receive","They do a good job","They already do a good job","better communication and proper response time","I'm already getting the best serves","Satisfied","unsure","i really think they did a great job the 4 1/2 years my child attended the program","come to my house","Make sure the schoolwork coincides with the instructions in the books being used for all classes","Everything is fine the way it its","na","Nothing, I think you do a fantastic job.","By continuing to be flexible. For the elementary level I would like to see more options for portfolios if possible. I would also like to see directions be more age appropriate where my child can follow instructions with little supervision. I think some of the assignments are too complicated to follow for his age and it would help build confidence by doing this. I have a child whose in high that makes more modifications and for my elementary level child no modification are made.","give individualized survey's for each child, more options portfolios, the wording on the tests and portfolios seems very complicated \r\n","I am very happy with CCA's services and can't think of anything else.","Like I mentioned earlier, the portfolios can be very time consuming.  Our 8th grader spent 3 hours just on her science portfolio the other day, and this seems to be the trend in the higher grades. \r\n\r\n I also feel that the middle school grades should be required to have spelling tests.  I am horrified at what some of her classmates type in the chat pod on their live lessons as well as on the discussion boards.  Their grammar and spelling is worse than what my 4th grader types.","You do great","At this point I believe CCA has covered everything that we need.","Some lessons were unclear and we had a lot of problems with the equipment.","Education technology is a big old waste of time, to be blunt. Please get rid of this class!!","More parental tools","I would like to know more about the school tailoring assignments to meet the child's needs. So far, my child is struggling tremendously, but I'm not really seeing extra help.","It would be nice to have more connections with other parents. There used to be more field trip opportunities and now there aren't as many and the price went up. There aren't as many activities for elementary kiddos to get involved in to feel like they are a part of the school, especially in a rural area like we live in. \r\nThe only other complaint I have is with special education help. My student has been in extra reading classes since kindergarten,  and still every year she has to wait MONTHS to start these classes again. I feel that she should automatically be placed in these classes until she tests out.  Not waste half the year with testing and paperwork before she can even get help.  We have had to do a lot of the work ourselves here to help her move forward. It seems that every year there is some new program CCA is trying out and no one is organized :( The kids are the ones being hurt by this, and it should really get ironed out before the new school year even starts. Sorry to vent a bit,  but it is a big deal for us here with a struggling reader. Other than this issue we absolutely love CCA.","All of the teachers should have to obligated to help the student on the same level.  Mrs. Mary Frances Thorn told me no one ever helped her along her educational path. My son only attended CCA and I did not expect to have a negative attitude after CCA curriculum was a great asset for his future education but his experience with two teachers ended up in hurting his overall experience.","Have no question this school is terrific!","Hard decision to choose a college and how to get grants?","Maybe more social events","Nothing I can think of","Have goal setting classes for high school and guidance class for focusing on who they what to become.   My daughter now in 9th grade has matured through CCA.  Is working on selling her art and needs to set up web store and all that goes with it.  If you could have someone to put her on the right path on who and what. That would be helpful ...","I cannot think anything now I am just satisfied on the progress the child has progressing so far this year.Thank you.","There is no better way .In my opinion they  just fine they way  they are.","I am extremely satisfied with how my child as progressed and the treatment and services we have been provided.","we just have problems with portfolios until they are completed the students cant continue to the next lesson","I feel they are doing an awesome job.","Don't make communication with staff and Livelessons mandatory","CCA has served out family so well over the past four years and I am so thankful that we had a choice for my Noah.","please listen to the parents concerns, even if it doesn't fit what your school thinks should happen","They have done a fine job...I really like CCA","It cant\r\n","Continued support for new families.

My daughter knows no other school other than yours. She has been with you since kindergarden and she is now in 6th grade.","CCA is doing everything above and beyond what was expected","For our family, I would have liked to see more live lessons for my 5th grader, so there would have been more instruction on lessons and maybe less live lessons or planner work for my special needs 8th grader. I didn't see many, if at all, opportunities for socialization for my children in my area.","I really miss the extra live lessons.   If we had to miss a lesson the recorded lesson was available.  My student needs the extra teaching.  We chose CCA originally due to the amount of live lessons.  It was very similar in schedule to a brick and mortar school for those that are not easily self taught.  Our experience this year was a let down after our 2 previous years.  We went from 4 live lessons to 2 in most areas and from 2 to 1 in others.  CCA is just like all the other cyber schools now.  I still like the cyber idea, but CCA no longer is above and beyond all the rest.","the teachers and the staff can respond a lot better to emails and calls and actually walk or explain how to do certain things on here when the child doesn't understand and when a child enters this school after the start date don't expect them to play catch up in the work when they where not there from the start !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","You can't make it any better than it already is. My daughter has been with you since kindergarden and will be with you for the rest of her school years.","HAVE BEEN WELL SERVED","I would like to see more social events to allow for more peer interaction in person.  The field trips don't always promote that due to time constraints. In addition, there isn't enough field trips within the region or more that are non-paying and simply allow for the children to get together and mingle.","you can't make it any better than it already is.","Bring back the end of the year get together.","Continue to treat every child as an individual.

We are extremely satisfied with all aspects of this school.","I honestly don't know how they could do anything better.  We think CCA is wonderful!","I think the response from the teachers needs to improve.  There are many teachers in this school year, I as the learning coach and parent, have not even talked to.  My son was failing two separate grades and not one teacher contacted me to tell me he was in trouble.  I was 9 months pregnant, in and out of the hospital with complications and I had no help from most of his teachers.  I think contact should of been made that my son was having issues regardless if I was pregnant or not.","I am satisfied, as is.","Nothing I can think of right now","They are already amazing","keep doing what you guys are doing","A sports program or club that actually meets instead of video conferencing.","Tech Support has always been a burden for me. For example, I am positive that my son's computer needs a new battery but I cannot get one from tech support unless I talk to someone over the phone in order to trouble shoot. I rather not do that, so we just keep the computer plugged in at all times. Any other issue I have would apply to all public schools (Common Core Math and PSSA testing).","only have trouble up loading the portfolios to the teacher.","I feel that the computer that my son is using is too old. I would like him to have a new school issued computer.","Give back the flexibility that you claim is a Benefit of cyberschool\r\n","More freedom for Learning Coaches.

It is his own fault but it would have been nice if teachers noticed and contacted him to see if they could suggest anything or help in any way. He is brilliant but his perfectionist tendencies put him behind.","The only thing I dislike about CCA is the use of Common Core Math.  BUt I understand that is through the state and I would have to deal with this anywhere she went.","Provide ink for printers twice a year.","I WISH the government would STOP trying to dictate my child's education. We know our children better than some official.  They are all influenced by money, not by what is right.\r\nMy child has improved 60% since coming here.

I sometimes have trouble finding the details, and I lose track of when they are due.","n/a","Although I really love CCA, I have been increasingly dissappointed with the services provided to the students/families over the last few years. As with all schools with the budget cuts, CCA has cut services directly related to the students. We as parents would like to see the yearly financial reports. Has CCA cut staff or other services? Or just student-related services?","Unsure.","We would like a more timely and more in depth answers from the teachers when asking questions other than student is not following instructions.  We would like to see grade books updated in a more timely manner.  We would like to see tests and assignments that are in the email updated in our planners also and not just in our emails.","I am very satisfied with CCA.  I do have a few suggestions to improve the overall experience. 1.I would like to see more live lessons for younger children.  La and math are great but science and social studies are important to be taught in LL too. 2. I would like to see a consistency in information provided by teachers ie syllabus for lessons taught each week. 3. I would like to see the new field trip rules changed.  I feel my children have missed far too many educational as well as social oppurtunities because of the rules.  I think families should have the oppurtunity to self pay for additional trips.  Overall CCA has been a great choice for my girls.  With more consistent structure I feel CCA can be a fantastic cyber charter school!","PLEASE stop having the teachers send so many emails.

Examples: pushing sex ed agendas on younger kids, talking down the founders of the nation, singing soft and sweet about Muslim predators who \"tolerate Christians\" (enslave and tax them) while Christian Europeans are depicted as \"intolerant\" and \"aggressive\". I wish I had specific references, but I don't. There is a mindset sneaking into texts about our culture and the very moral basis of our family standards. It's not CCA's fault, in a way; I blame Pearson. I would love it if our school was neither owned by Pearson nor beholden to them in any way. Freedom of choice means- more choices!","Try not to have the planner so far ahead of the class because my child feels the need to be up to date and does not want to fall behind.","Let us choose the times of the middle school and high school live lessons.

I think the grading percentages are way off.  The portfolios are often worth more and many times the require learning coach assistance.  I feel that tests should always be worth more than portfolios.  Also there should be more review material available for all subjects before a test.

It takes way too long to receive things. That department is also not prepared at all with having enough equipment on hand to be sent quick enough. It's horrible how long its taking to get a printer (even a set of headphones). I ordered something online a few days after my sons equipment that's being replaced and they got here the same day? Something definitely needs to be done about that. That is my only complaint!","Unsure.","CCA could better serve my family and other families by cutting out so MANY, MANY portfolios and reduce the content and context of the portfolios. The portfolios also need to be moved out of the lesson schedule and just simply be due on a certain date, so students don't get hung-up doing a portfolio and then get behind in their lesson schedule. I think less quick-checks and portfolios and more time given to actually learn the material instead of seeing how much we can cover in one year.","Please bring back unlimited field trips.  These are so important for the kids.  It is their way of meeting up with their CCA friends and to remain social.  When you can only attend one \"paid\" trip a month, a lot of the time you have to hope their friends picked the same one.  We built friendships last year at field trips and it has been difficult to meet up with them this year.  Field trips were one of the factors in picking CCA as our cyber school.","Please open up field trips again and make them unlimited.  These were great ways for my kids to make and keep up with friends.  Now if we get to see them once a month, we are lucky.  These kids need to have that social time with others in their school so they can hang out with other students who are going through the same things.","n/a","I'm very satisfied with everything at CCA","Even though the teachers here are great, some of them could be a little more enthusiastic when talking. Some of the teachers can put you to sleep when talking.","There needs to be modified classes in subjects other than reading and math for students with IEPs and learning disabilities.  This year 5th grade SRA students are piloting a program in Schoology for Science and Social Studies.  My student just started this program and it is more on her level.  The students with IEPs have a hard time even with modifications to achieve success in these courses (example: my daughter's reading is at a Kindergarten/ First grade level; however, Science and Social Studies material is at a Fifth grade level-- it's too much for her).  The pilot program seems to be helping her at this time.  She is not so overwhelmed and shutting down during these classes.  I would love to see this be an option for student who need this at any grade level. \r\n I know my 6th grader is struggling a lot this year with the increased workload and difficulty of the curriculum.  She has an IEP, as well.  Her reading is behind, but not too far behind.  She struggles with processing information and this year she has many more modifications than in the previous years, but an alternative Science and Social Studies class option would be helpful.  I do not want her to drop these courses completely.  These are important subjects to learn, but she is not going to be able to get everything from these classes.  She need the \"meat and potatoes\" or main points, but she gets lost in all the details.","Improve communication between special education teachers and homeroom or individual subject teacher (depending on grade).  Currently, this is good.  However, there are times when it is slow (more on the regular teacher's end).","I really cannot think of anything I am dissatisfied with. Our children have become independent learners and know exactly what to do if they need additional help with their assignments. \r\n\r\nI love the field trip offerings provided by CCA, though we are unable to attend many of them. I do wish, however, the end of year field trip to Kennywood could be reinstated. That was reward to our children for a year well done. They loved the opportunity to meet up with some of their classmates at the amusement park.","Keep up the good work, you're doing fine, thank you.","I would like to be able to see the same home page as my child, as well as working links to live lessons, and teacher contact pages.

These ones are unable to join in the activities that are held at the Seven Fields office as well as getting school pictures and that's, to say the least, unfair.  If there was a way to implement a closer office or for arrangements to be made to transport the less fortunate children, this would be the perfect alternative to public schooling","Try to get away from confusing and ridicules common core curriculum.","Continued, constructive feedback from teachers is essential to drive instruction and promote success.  This is especially true for children in asynchronous programs.  My child has/had amazing teachers who strive/strove to establish a connection and support academic and social/emotional growth.  Unfortunately, my child recently had one teacher who provided little to no feedback over the course of an entire semester.  Although this did not seem to affect my child's grades, it did affect her desire to set and reach goals.  My child's new teacher is working diligently to reconnect and we are seeing her enjoy learning once again.","I have been saying for the last 7 years that live lessons should be mandatory in every class.","I wish the Teachers would call my child back when they leave a message to call back.","I am happy with the service that CCA provides to my family.","Reach out to students if  getting behind to see if they need help.","Having more local field trips for the children in the city of Pittsburgh and providing transportation for students attending PSSA test and field trips. My child never gets to go to any of CCA's field trip's because most of them are an hour or two hours away.

There needs to be more time for portfolio's to be completed my child is always panicking when there is so many assignment's due around the same time. This makes him not be able to have free time or play outside with friends. It is to much for a child not to be able to have play time when he has so much work to do daily it is too much and sad for the children!!!!!!","CCA does a fantastic job.","Hmm, that's tough.  Maybe have the teacher and their students in the same part of the state. Create an even stronger bond with seeing them at more field trips and CCA events in their area.

But glad to know you strive to do so.","Keep up the good work!","That a tough one, considering how amazing this school is! only thing I can think of is maybe check the existing educational links in the lessons.

I would consider a different program like iRead or something like it.  Also, to have some kind of application to practice math skills online.  Perhaps ipads or tablets would be incorporated in the curriculum to help have familiarity with these technologies and applications.  A coding program for younger children would also be helpful.  As for learning languages, I don't see why it shouldn't be offered for very young students.  They are capable of learning a different language early on.  Advanced classes are also appreciated for the student who gets easily bored when not challenged.  Incorporating some classical subjects would also be great content for education.","The school is fine where it is.","It is doing a great job on serving us.","Update your curriculum, currently too much material is presented it to short a time span. For example, the Great Depression and causes leading up to WWII is a one day class. Upgrade your electives. Sign Language needs a book or software program, not links to free software that is difficult to search and has pop-up ads. The health elective is difficult, the online lessons in a font that is almost unreadable it is so small and the class needs a book. The new special ed reading program lessons are fine but the read 44 software is boring for my child, 20 minutes spelling lesson with no rewards. The math 180 program takes too long on a particular topic and my child is not getting a variety of math topics. For example, they have been on fractions since the beginning of the school year. The math 180 program has games as a reward which is  a plus but takes very long drawn out methods to get to an answer. For example, to multiple fractions, they use a 8 step process. Science should have more labs. When parents give feedback the teacher's, the program coordinator and the principals should all listen. I have had principals in the past who never replied, even when it was a compliment. The read 44 program coordinator said the problems my son was having with the software was our internet and that we had too many people streaming programs at home. Meanwhile, as a programmer I had sent a thoughtful explanation of the errors and how HMH could fix it and explained that we had a hard wired DSL internet and only my son was on the internet and neither my husband nor I were on the internet. You need to respect and reply to parents.","CCA does a great job. Keep up the great work.","N/A","I believe CCA is doing a great job.","With so much college prep on the horizon, it would be nice to receive alerts on testing and activities that need completed and alerts on when.

And some kind of check mark system to see if child attended each live lesson that day.","Try to get rid of Common Core.","The curriculum is sometimes all over the place -- it would be nice for those with an educator's eye to go in and clean up some of the errors and consider the child on the other end. The math teacher is amazing, but the math program goes way too quickly and we are having to spend a lot of extra time reinforcing and finding supplemental materials because the text and the program rushes through the concepts or only touches upon them superficially with not a lot of examples; at the same time, some of the curriculum feels like overkill -- too much of the same thing over and over.  I wish it felt more consistent and uniform. \r\n\r\nAlso, the \"electives\" that aren't credited courses NEED to be disclosed upfront. The \"integrated\" curriculum course that turned out NOT TO BE INTEGRATED, was presented as part of my son's schedule and then I later learned it wasn't mandatory, and I'm not sure why it wasn't disclosed upfront. \r\n\r\nWe've also found minor errors/typos throughout the year on the tests and in the lessons; at first, it was no big deal; people make errors, but when it has been dozens of minor errors here and there, it starts to be frustrating and I wonder why teachers aren't noticing them. \r\n\r\nOn a last note, though, for the most part I really like the texts and most of the teachers have been wonderful. We also love Brain Pop as a supplement -- what an awesome learning tool! I'm not a fan of technology or movies taking the place of a teacher, but much of what my son has gained from the program has come from the Brain Pop videos and our further exploration of the concepts they cover.","not requires labs for classes its hard for people to obtain the proper supplies and also hard to teach the stuff to my child","Fix the glitch that does not show when my child attends classes. Not sure if this is her laptop that is the issue but she constantly shows alarms and I physically see her login to classes.","My child is a special needs teen. There are no electives for the special needs kids in the high school although I believe they are required to take electives. \r\nMy daughter, in our town public HS, has registered for a drawing class for one of her electives. Perhaps it would be possible to have a simple, step by step drawing class for the students and perhaps a cooking class as well. \r\nLast, I am very supportive and thankful for CCA and how far my son has come with the help of his teachers. However, the Read 180 program, although the strategies are helpful, the content of the stories seem to be geared towards inner city students or at risk students... ex. survivors, killer plagues, combat zones, your brain exposed, crime, punishment and teens? The selections just don't seem appropriate for special needs teens. In fact, whereas I usually read and reread selections with my child, this year I chose to skim over many parts. Perhaps for next year there is another SRA series or a Read180 program with more uplifting and appropriate stories.","This year's teachers, Yellow 'Team' 7th grade were the worst we've had since we enrolled in 3rd grade. They insist that their schedule is followed daily &amp; only kids who attend their live lessons get special bonus points. This is supposed to be a learning environment at your own pace. It isn't. Ms. Griffins insists they don't fall behind or work ahead. Ms. Keim has walked out of live lessons when the kids frustrate her. Ms. Boost was emailed when we needed help, only to be told 'Come to LiveLesson'. We do. Every day. Their Friday tutoring is only on whatever they feel like tutoring on. Students can't ask individual questions. It is ridiculous. I am having to 'teach' more than I did in elementary school. No wonder PSSA scores are awful.","Access to field trips could be better, especially for parents that do not drive. Also, material for selected courses, like Spanish, could be requested and sent with school material at beginning of year.","This program is excellent.

Even if they are not having any trouble.","Help me to figure out if kindergarten and first grade in terms of curriculum and socialization will be better than my youngest going to public school, as I would like both of my children to be able to go to the same type of school.","work on the issue of getting all the lessons and the information needed to complete that work in the same book to save hunting as it delays the learning process and time consumed while teaching. I believe that if it was made smoother, small children would not lose interest, and get bored  waiting for the learning coach to fine materials.","I feel that some lessons are so intense. My daughter will sometimes have to work for 10 hours just to complete everything she is asked to do. Sometime a teacher will assign a test, she will take it and then the teacher will have changed the plan and assign another test. It happens often, and it's very confusing. If there is a plan.... Stick to it! Some of your students are ambitious and get ahead.","You need to provide MUCH more supplies to your students!!  The science curriculum requires many resources that many students don't have.  Give them the soil, rocks etc to complete these tasks.  Give them protractors etc.  You focus too much time on just math and language arts.  If a child has a question in science or social studies they have to figure it out on their own or wait for a teacher response.  These kids need actual live lessons in these areas as well.  These subjects are equally important, and it seems they are just an after thought in your school.  Having one hour of just LA and math is a huge disservice to these kids.  Also, the LA curriculum is too rigorous. You have these kids reading books on their own, plus books for a lesson.  They are spending soo much time reading and writing book reports and summaries, and barely touching on LA subjects like syllables, C/VC words, word sounds etc. Teachers need to follow the book or at least let parents know when they are veering from the textbook or workbooks.  Some lessons in math are not even covered by a live lesson.  Your new teachers with minimal experience need to be monitored more.  Our teacher is rude, abrasive and more concerned with being in control than having fun, fixing her hair in the web monitor, being prepared and teaching.  If the teachers are more prepared there wouldn't be so much down time in a live lesson.  Down time in a live lesson is a death sentence to little kids...their attention goes out the window and they get distracted.  Additionally, there are very few social activities at CCA as compared to other charters.  You need more interaction for these kids.  Field trips, book fairs (actual books in an office to come and look at, not just a flyer), art classes, music classes.  And make MUCH MORE of an effort to get these close to all kids. Westmoreland County has barely any resources available to their kids via CCA.  We have to travel too far.  You also need to give parents a better step by step guide on teaching lessons.  Many lessons will start by saying \"Remind your child what ___ means\"  or \"Start by explaining ___\".  No!  Give the explanation to the parents.  There are many parents who don't have the skills or knowledge to teach their kids.","Nothing","Nothing","Keep your teachers so that the children have stability, make sure to listen to families when they say theyou are having difficulties and help fix the problems instead of making them worse.  Keep to your word. When we enrolled in connections acadamy we enrolled in a school that had flexibility for learning and time and travel. Every reason we signed up for is no longer valid according to Mr Natale who is trying to ruin my oldest sons senior year, which has been continuing to get harder with another new teacher who decided to give him permanently zeros without warning him she is not staying with the old teachers rule of taking their time and turning in great work. She gave no notice that he would get permanent zeros just gave them and said oh well. This is his last few months of high school, he is a merit scholar recipient a straight A student and hard worker but also a perfectionist. He takes learning seriously as do all my children yet he is now being punished because his teachers are being replaced and changing the rules without notification. We are extremely unhappy with the new charter acadamy","Just continue to be around.","Can't think of any","You need an app for the connexus","Honestly the communication from the CCA team is outstanding and I can't think of anything specific that could be better.","Na","Less modifications","Continue to communicate all graduation requirements are met prior to May.","wish there was a school closer incase my student would need some tutoring with some of her classes","NA","I honestly don't have any issues or concerns with CCA. My child is doing much better under your watch. Thank you.","Doing a great job don't need anything else","I am actually pleased with CCA, I just hope my son will be able to attend when he is in high school.","When dealing with IEP students, which I have 4, I feel the general Education teachers need more training when it comes to adhering to the IEP modifications, and training in dealing with students who have mental and learning problems, and are not at the same level as other students. They can not expect the same level from IEP students, and need to better understand not to give the same kind of work load to students with these severe IEP.  Some Gen Ed teachers seem like they do not understand why they need to adjust, and do not know how to talk to or work with students with sever learning disabilities.","na","Stop having assigmnemts outside of the assigned assignments. Sometimes it's hard to follow because the planner says one thing and the assignment is something else.

We were excited to get the art supplies and science experiment supplies and they sit unopened in her desk here at the end of the year. She has asked to go back to the brick and mortar local public school next year and I agree that will be best.","I'm fine","I can't think of anything.","The diagnosis of autism should be handled in a more timely manor. I adjusted my sons IEP in November. It is the end of March now and we are finally having an OT visit to help us get my son the help he needs. Having to wait on the school to handle finding someone to do the diagnosis shouldn't take that long. For months my son and I have struggle to to stay caught up with the required work. Yes, we have been in regular contact with his teachers, but that only helps so much with a child he suffers in unknown ways and feels lost and left out because he thinks and handles thing differently than other children his age.  I was unaware that this school is mainly based out of the Philadelphia area. We live near Pittsburgh and have limited  activities that we can join in with.","Nothing needed. Thank you.","Nothing I can think of.","teachlet  applications should be removed","We need more live lessons. The 4th grade science, social studies, PA history is far too hard for a student to do without teacher involvement. The curriculum is SO advamced.. Example, learning excel in 4th grade!","Have more field trips in the Indiana County area.","Nothing at this time.","Now that we understand the CCA system, we are doing fine.","CCA has done a top notch job. We are completely satisfied.","Perhaps by entertaining a more flexible learning curriculum.  For instance, I prefer Saxon math and would like the option to do that over the current option provided. But I understand the complexities associated with providing a whole other program. So it's a bit of a compromise I make for the other parts of CCA that works well.","I wish there was an end of the year field trip, for families to get together.  Also, it would be great if, instead of the Community Class Reimbursement, the class could be paid upfront by CCA.  A lot of families can't afford to pay the costs, even if they are getting reimbursed.","One way we could be better served is that when my child has the option to take the modified test. We usually have to wait until the teacher gets to grading it sent by email. Where as if they modify the actual test, so it can be entered right in the actual test, then the student can move on.  Now we have to wait until the teacher grades it through email and then we get lessons behind because we cannot move on.  Or the teacher knows what students take the modified tests, they can skip over the actual test in the lesson so the student can move on until the teacher gets the modified test graded.","none its great they way it is","fine as is","Everything has been wonderful.","CCA does a great job of serving me, so at this moment, I cannot think of anything.","things are going well so far","At this time I cannot think of anything.","no ways","Don't know.","your doing everything GREAT","i really wish they would choose to focus more on subjects that are needed for life skills--and especially to ones that are IEP students","More local field trips.  Field trips are too far away.  With gas the way it is, it is hard to afford the trips.","I have no problems to say at this time.","By providing more social service help.","The only thing I can think of would be more collaboration with child's teachers.","I would like to see more events whether it be social or educational in my area, and I would like if the family center that recently opened in my area would put out more communication with the CCA students and families  either with planning social events or educational ones to make us feel included like other  family centers do in their areas.","More great session availability","Only real issues i my child had was how they label the live lessons which i feel should just be done by the unit and the lesson and some teachers could get back to me sooner","no\r\n","I can't think of a reason","After the Schools we went through before CCA, I don't think that there is a better way..  Maybe adding a Science class to the kindergarten but that is about it...  Its tough teaching Science to a 5 year old.","I'm satisfied with the way CCA serves me and my family now.","Im Not really sure","They are perfect !","Put the lessons in connexus and not in the push pin. It is very confusing to have a lesson and then a totally different one in the push pin.","Consider working with a Vocational School. My son was interested in going to our local VoTech but was told that CCA does not work with that.","CCA has served both our family and child well.","Already do enough","For the high school curriculum you cannot change the schedule.  While on vacation, they are accumulating overdue lessons.  I needed to change my spring break days.  We will make it up during spring break, but it would be nice to come back and not see 38 overdue lessons.","im satisfied","I am not sure.  I prefer more parental security on the computers.  I understand CCA added a program to help this, but I am unsure about the quality of the program.","not sure.

It isn't set up to easily take advantage of and from what I noticed, the ones we could take advantage of (because of location) were not educational.","More local social events in our area.","The sliders on the satisfaction survey would not move, all stuck at 5.

School liaison should be able to help more I feel like I'm spinning my wheels when talking to her because she can't really do anything","I'm not sure what can be done better to serve us","When calling tech support it doesn't take so long","There are several things that CCA could do to better serve us.  Foremost, CCA could establish a relationship with Butler County Community College (BC3.)  They are a wonderful resource for students in our area - which is in close proximity to the Seven Fields office.  BC3 offers the \"Presidential Scholarship\" to local students who demonstrate excellent academic performance.  This is my families 8th year with CCA.  My son, a junior, has a 4.0. If he was a student of our local district (either cyber participant or in the actual classroom,) he would receive free tuition at the community college.  This isn't being offered to him as a student of CCA because no relationship exists.  I believe that it would be a benefit to CCA to reach out to BC3 to establish that relationship on multiple levels.\r\nA second way that CCA could serve us better is to provide more text books.  Over the past 8 years, we have witnessed a major shift in the text books being provided to my students.  Resources that were provided to my older student are not being provided to my younger student.  This is discouraging as it was one of the major reasons that we chose CCA.  My students do better with physical, tangible books.  We have requested them, and have been repeatedly told that the same curriculum that my older student had received prior - isn't available.\r\nThe major way that CCA can serve us better is opportunity/event proximity.  Both of my students are in the National Honor Society.  There is to be a luncheon and ceremony at the end of the week in Harrisburg - several hours away.  We live in Western PA.  It feels that we are often forgotten and left out.  We have experienced the ups and downs in the growing pains of CCA, and have tried to be realistic in our expectations.  We have witnessed much progress for instance, when PSSA testing locations went from being 50 minutes of travel time away from us to 10.  Unfortunately, that has again changed, and the sites are no longer local for us.  \r\nEach year, we must weigh the pros and cons of continuing with CCA.  I have seriously considered switching to the local school district's cyber school, for the use of actual text books, close testing, and most important to us is the huge financial benefit of being able to receive scholarship funds.  I do hope that you will equally consider these items.","I'm honestly not sure\r\n","CCA does such a great job. I can think of no way to improve on their excellence!","Improve the hardware available to all students","Coca does such a great job, I can't think of any way to improve this school!","Sometimes middle school teacher have quite a bit of meetings and workshops, would prefer they have more time to do Live Lessons.","Some of the teachers are teaching chapters in live lesson that do not align with what is due on the school planner. They are teaching at times an entire unit ahead and it's hard to catch up to them. It is better when teachers are teaching concepts or chapters that are right on target (within a lesson or two) of what is on the planner.","CCA does a great job on everything that we have seen. We think that the learning levels for kindergarten are a little tough but our five year old twins are doing very well. Just seems like the expectations for kindergaten are really high when its supposed to be an easy 1st year for children. Other than that we really enjoy CCA.","don't know","I would like to see small group meetings. Parents, students, teachers and counselors having small group, round table meetings once a month at administration offices. Topics to discuss such as; what brought you here? What do you do in your spare time? How do neighbors/friends respond to you choosing a cyber school? Do you ever have to defend your decision to cyber school? How do you defend your decision to cyber school? \r\nI think cyber school families need a place to talk about these things and feel a part of a supportive community.","Have teacher respond to students call better.","My daughter has been with CCA for 3 years. She joined the Adventure club the very first year and has been a part of it all three years. We just found out that it will be absorbed into the field trips and will no longer be a club. I wish that this decision could be reevaluated. The Adventure club was a small group of students that formed a strong bond with each other. It only met once a month and the students looked forward to seeing each other at the events. It will be very much missed since it served as one of my daughter's only social outlets. Please reconsider it's removal.","There should be more time allotted for live lessons for the AP classes - these are very challenging courses and to meet only once or twice a week is too little.","they do it all now","It seems as though this year CCA has been more disorganized when it comes to getting answers and finding out who to speak with at times. I also think the high school workload is a bit much.","They do everything now.  I don't see how you can be better than the best","As a parent, I have been satisfied with CCA.  However, I have found this past year that students need more opportunities for Live Lessons and study guides.","Everything is great","All around we have been mostly happy with CCA, the only trouble I would like to see fixed is with some of the curriculum. On several occasions the guide book did not have the correct answers or did not have answers at all.

Make it more fun and the kids will excel and want to do better rather than feel forced into having to achieve high scores. Lose the common core.

The resolution finally came from a suggestion from his teacher after I reached out to her. Also we were never contacted nor were we given any information on a family mentor, until just literally 2 weeks ago.

Socialization is a very important part of the teens life.  Also having autism makes socializing quite important.  Really miss the end of year get togethers where we meet the families and teachers.","need more guidance in course selections for high school students.","Clearer directions on assignments. A minority of the teachers consistently change expectations on the assignments. They differ from the syllabus and cause a great deal of confusion having to go back and forth between the updated expectations and the original expectations. Also, the verbosity of the expectations is excessive. It leads to confusion. Clearer, more concise expectations would be beneficial.","N/a","I have had only positive experiences so far","It would be nice to see classes that start together move up a grade together.  My son made several good friends in kindergarten and they were from the same part of the state but they didn't end up in first grade together and he really missed them.  I was able to request that he be put in their class for second grade and they were all happy to be back together again so it would be nice if classes were moved up together so that friendships can form, it is hard enough in this environment to make friends since they don't necessarily meet face to face so maybe there could be a form sent to the parents when they file their intent to return where they could request either a teacher or classmates that their child would like to remain in class with.","I am pretty satisfied overall with CCA. The only thing that might make it better is to have more satellite locations.","Make it easier to get in touch with tech support. More support for children with learning disabilities in high school level.","The resource books are difficult to follow. We have been with other cyber schools and one had books that had the pages marked by school days. For example, the lessons for the first day of school where marked Day 1. Everything required for that day (worksheets and lessons) was marked Day 1. It was also all together. You did not have to search through the book to find worksheets for each lesson. This made it easy to follow.","Put all the book work and pages they need to do for each subject on page one or two . It will help them be prepared , have all books needed right away. They shouldn't have to go through each page to find what they need to do . Most times they miss a book , page or two cause they are hard to find . It would be less stress to have listed all on one end page . That is the biggest problem with cca , needs to be more clear for the kids to succeed .","My oldest daughter is in High School.She is doing fairly good in her classes.But my younger daughter is in special ed.and is doing good in her live lesson classes that are specifically for special ed.But her general courses are a great struggle for her,and it is very difficult for her to pass these classes(social studies, science and on line learning)due to it being too hard,and not spending enough time on each subject before jumping to the next.Other than that,everything is good.","Closer location for grade level graduations. I don't feel the Spanish program is adequate. My son is not interested, he loses focus and isn't really catching on, the live lessons were not what I expected and only made my son and I both more confused, he is not interested in that extra class again next year. The educational technology program is also not one of our favorites, the program is hard to set up with all of the extra downloads, and he doesn't really catch on to any of that information either.","CCA is a fairly good school.But with my child that has special needs,I feel her needs were not met.The curriculum is too difficult for her and it has been a very big struggle for her.Her requirements for her classes were modified,but the course work did not change,it is the same,only shortened.So that did not help her.She has really had a hard time this year,and it has changed my opinion of it from last year.","Explain better why I have to complete her assignments before they can be graded.  Better explain what counts for attendance.  A physical handbook instead of trying to find the information online.","n/a","In the math curriculum the parents need access to how to work out a problem not just the answer to some questions, so we can better help our students. There are too many live lessons, taking up too much of the day, and removing the flexibility that we need. There are frequently contradictions between directions for portfolios from teachers and lesson plans, there needs to be clarification. Tests and quizzes in several of the 10th grade classes are dropped within the lessons but are added elsewhere making them difficult to find and easy to miss. In the 11 years we have been with CCA the virtual library has not gotten any easier to navigate. Adding the end of the grading periods, not just semester endings, to the calendar would make keeping track of how far a student is in the curriculum compared to where they need to be much easier.","Having a staff that makes the child feel that they are important.","I don't know.","the service is fine","I wish the gifted program was more about expanding the child's knowledge than loading them down with more work. It is like punishing a child for being intelligent. Also, this year one teacher accused my child of plagiarism because his essay was so well written. When the teacher was confronted she ended up apologizing, but it has made us have less confidence in the professionalism of the staff.","The format for which students with IEP receive their modified materials should be streamlined.  It is confusing that each teacher has their own format as to how to access modified assessments.  Some teachers want called, some have the material on the message board, and unfortunately some teachers have to be reminded consistently that the modified materials are needed.  They should all be accessible in the same format to make it easier for the student and the learning coach.","Our problems have been with the teacher taking a long time to respond to questions then not really answering the question at all. Many times the links to video's in the lessons don't work. The teachers mic sometimes doesn't work and kids miss lessons because they can't hear her (called tech support and they said the problem is with the teachers equipment and they can't do anything about that).Kids are given assignments (math especially) that have no answer keys available for parents or even to the teacher (as stated by her). 3-4 portfolios due at the same time and very long days needed to complete all the work load. My son is supposed to have OT, but only had one for three visits all year. Questions are on work pages and tests that weren't covered yet in lessons or were skipped over until a later unit.","One of my children has an IEP.  It would be more helpful for my student and me if all her modifications were in a central location (modification tool).  Right now, she has to go to several places in order to obtain her modified assessments.  It depends on the teacher what format they use for modifications and I feel it should be in the same format and location for all teachers.  I often have to request modifications, even though they are supposed to be available.  Some of the teachers do not communicate back to me in a timely manner.  Some teachers do not offer feedback on questions that are missed.  I feel that feedback is important so my students can learn from their mistakes.  The curriculum is often based on state testing, instead of a well rounded lesson plan.  This year there has been a lot of issues with audio for several teachers.  We have been unable to understand several live lessons due to the audio problems.  I also feel that there should be stricter rules during live lessons.  I have observed the same students every day disrupting the live lessons, and nothing is ever done about it.  It is distracting and takes away from the lesson for the students that are there to learn.","Unsure.","My son has an IEP. I feel the portfolios and some of the teachers are pretty tough on him.

Like maybe advanced reading groups instead of just groups for kids having trouble or science and social studies live lessons.  The live lessons are great.  Also, some of the teachers use the technology available to them to the best of their ability, Ms. Wissinger and Ms. Grafton for two examples that I have had experience.  Other teachers just talk in the background and I feel that they should all incorporate technology into their lessons.  I've seen both types of lessons and I know that my children take more away from the more interactive ones.  My phone is 814-354-2325 if you would like to talk further about any of this.","so far i have no issues.","Keep up the great work!","Keep doing what you have been doing!","I find the level of care, professionalism, and curriculum to be right where it needs to be.","I am satisfied with everything about CCA","Keep up the good work!

Have the teachers more involved with students. Sticking to the curriculum in live lessons. Also the books and parent guide books going along with the guide exactly.","we are new and just getting adjusted having wifi any where right in the lap top would be efficient\r\n","I have been very happy!!!!","I can't think of anything that you don't already do. I like the teachers and their ability to care about the students","Nothing at this time that I can think of","Administrators need to respond in a timely manner. The teachers all respond very quickly, but administrators take forever. Perhaps they are overloaded, and this issue needs to be addressed?","Improve the curriculum.  Common core math thus far seems very obtuse at times and uses nomenclature that no one uses in Math.  For example number sentences rather than informing kids they are called equations.  Reading curriculum doesn't stress phonics enough but rather mixes phonics with too many sight words.  Reading also focuses on vocabulary words that are far beyond the scope of what a typical K-student can handle.  Amazing words, rather than actually teaching words the kids typically could sound out, spell and would use themselves.  The K-level decodable books are for the most part horribly dull and most of the times aren't really stories, you may as just well have the kids read sentences with the applicable sounds from the lesson.  Some lessons require extensive time and some end up being fairly short, but the lack of balance sometimes makes it difficult to schedule.  I supplement heavily to challenge my child and if she didn't already know how to read well and the like I would be highly dissapointed with much of the reading curriculum in particular and the math to some degree as well.  I hope that something beyond this Pearson common core information is used in the years to come, the curriculum although interesting with the videos and activities I find lacking overall.  Phonics based reading and teaching students where they are, rather than attempting to mix in more advanced \"comprehension\" via amazing words and the like can't be helpful for students in excelling at the fundamentals.  If the curriculum improves I would be completely satisfied, but as it stands much of the Math/Reading information is not structured properly, likely because its attempting to align with common core testing down the road rather than helping children excel and learn terminology that everyone uses and they can easily learn without extraneous information.","Improve the curriculum, move away from common core Math as soon as possible.  Use testing that is more applicable for benchmarking rather than requiring guessing and an extreme amount of time.  Benchmarking assessments are FAR too long.  For this age range it should not be any longer than 20minutes.  Age appropriate testing is very important and tests that require 1 hour or more skew the data and don't follow developmentally appropriate testing standards.  More feedback from a parent/coach would provide better data. For example this years new Math assessment, which was highly innapropriate and did not allow for a child to end the test early when going into material that was far beyond the scope of the educational material.  \r\n\r\nAs an asynch student, the curriclum remains the main way we interface with CCA and its seems uneven at best.  At times the materail is very interesting and engaging.  At other times it is convoluted (some of the Math) and not age appropriate.  For example in Kindgergarten last year the students were supposed to do a portfolio on variables and independent variables.  This is beyond ridiculous, given they were still practing their letters at the time.  Overall the curriculum remains my number one frustration with CCA, particularly Math class.  Also projects that require students to engage in 30min activities at this age--are by their nature not appropriate.  I suggest looking at Psychological testing standards for what is developmentally appropriate times per age of the student.  Time and time again class projects are far to time intensive for the young age of the student.","everything is good at this time","Special needs children cannot keep up well in this program.  The gifted program overwhelmed my gifted students with work that they could not keep up with.  Please, make lessons that are consistent across the curriculum and accurate, as well as up to date.  Common core lessons are useless and I have had four students barely pass math now that they changed to this standard. Simple and straightforward would be so much more effective.  Listening to parent input would also be nice.","Language lessons on the website need to be more helpful for us teachers... Too chopped up and very vague ... Maybe more videos. I have not gone to school for this and have no back ground in teaching...very frustrating when she is not understanding and I am not sure how else to explain. I have to go to other websites to find information. Plus the message board...wow...this is a very confusing and complicated space!!! Hard to find information and when you do hard to find it again. Also how do we find the office or tech numbers? I have to keep asking my teacher for them!","Less background noise in LL. An easier to navigate message and information section (impossible to find tech number, have to log out and see it on the screen). More classroom videos, I do not have a teaching degree and am not sure how to present things in a different way than how I was taught. Less worksheets...They are so overwhelming. My daughter takes sometimes 20 mins on one! A parent to parent help area would be good, at times it is very hard and to have encouragement and tips would be helpful. All readers should be printed and sent out, not just on the computer. Plus all handouts. Thank you for listening.","Not sure at this time","I don't really know how to answer this question.","not sure","by having a satellite office in Erie, PA \r\n","Overall online speed improvements.","Make it easier for us to understand what you are teaching my student.","All is great","I THINK YOU SHOULD ALL KEEP DOING AS YOU ARE.

Also, don't overload with projects, labs and portfolios. Keep the basics and keep them strong.","Stay open! :)","Not sure.","We live in probably your least populated area NW PA in Erie. We were never able to connect with the robotics team leaders for online meetings because of the time zone differences and conflicts with Live Lessons. We tried Spanish as an elective but again it was too \"long distant\". Perhaps, since CCA is now pulling things in house and in state maybe you could add Spanish Live Lessons or a hands on Robotics club.","I really dislike the Language Arts Curriculum.  My child becomes very uninterested in it quickly.  The school has served us well.","They need to make up their mind whether Live Lessons are mandatory or not. My child has been in a cyber school environment since K. We have done self paced, virtual classroom and blended programs before coming to CCA. I understand CCA LL were at one time only 15 minutes to half hour long and were supplemental. Now LL are more or less mandatory and are routinely an hour and some have been almost  1 1/2 hrs when students are giving presentations or the topic must be fully covered that day. I don't have a problem with that because my child is in GT. But if the school day is supposed to be 6 hrs, and you add up all the LL for core classes plus LL for JGB, GT Science, art (which was doubled for A semester and none in B), health,and then time for gym, ed tech, Skills for Success,electives, field trips etc.  we come out at 8-9 hours a day and many weeks with a 6th full day to finish daily assignments and portfolios. As we go along the need for flexibility of scheduling and attending mandatory classes will become more of an issue for my child.","Remain open ! &lt;3","Do better job at giving information (at the beginning of the year) on how to get an individualized learning plan for a child as advertised.  For example, my son is a number of grades ahead in math, but he was not allowed to test for math until the mid year benchmarking assessments.  And then because he did not do well on the iready assessment, he is stuck doing math that he is well past and is extremely bored with.  His teacher has been informed he is ahead, but keeps testing him on the current grade level and has no information on moving to more advanced math.  The only class he was able to advance in is reading, even though he is pretty advanced in more subjects especially math.","The help desk is not as good this year. The hours and days that they are available has changed. The skill set does not seem as up to par as it was prior when CCA was part of the national school. Curriculum is concerning too. There used to be text books and corresponding workbooks for all subjects. Technology class is a grave concern. Health with gym is also over emphasized. Foreign language is important but not available at CCA. Technology students in this day and age will automatically pick up as the go. Children today are of the technology era. How well do they communicate with others especially since they are home schooled. How about teaching communication &amp; social interaction etiquette?  Also in our global economy how well will they fit in without knowledge of other languages &amp; cultures?"],["When we came to CCA we truly came looking for help and healing . We had some really bad experiences both with other students and faculty .  What we found with CCA was amazing and caring support both from teachers and staff .

Ms. Rux, and Mr. Gross are amazing!!!!!!!!","This is our second year of working wMy son had a horrible teacher last year that was never available, not did she call anyone back...EVER!

A week later, I tend to not remember what the problem was in the first place.",null,null,"Make the system more User Friendly.\r\n\r\nAnd possibly even, take a good look at the courses. There's an opportunity, with proper organization, to optimize the learning experience with \"Cross-Over\" projects/assignments.",null,null,null,null,null,null,"Overall I am extremely pleased with CCA this year. We had a few bumps in the road at the beginning of the year with my sons IEP. His file was misplaced; he was put in gifted courses, then general education for all 4 main courses, and then finally put into the 180 courses for math and reading. \r\nCCA has met my daughters education needs by allowing her to work at her own pace and advance through 1st and 2nd grade quickly. She is now in 3rd and being challenged by the curriculum and thriving! \r\nAs great as CCA is a few things were difficult this year, the first being field trips. It was frustrating to find out that I couldnt pay for a 2nd field trip myself and then find out later that the field trip was not full to begin with. If we are willing to pay for a trip on our own and not cost the school anything, why would you turn students away? After all the complaining from other families that they couldnt get into field trips because they were all filled up, my children have not been on 1 field trip that was at its max this year. \r\nAlso, I find it frustrating my daughters third grade teacher does not send out  an update of what is being covered in class and what needs to be covered on her own or with a learning coach. For example, the 3B, Unit 2, lessons 1-5, the story Sukis Kimono teaches about editorials. The portfolio due on day 4 -instructs the students to write an editorial on why they think it is important to be yourself. My daughter watched the lessons but the teacher never went over any aspects of an editorial, even though the assessments 1-4 ask questions about an editorial. The elementary live lessons often times seem to only go over the stories and grammar, leaving out the extra details that are covered on assessments. It would be nice if they teacher mention these things when sending out a weekly email. Such as, please read or please watch the video in lesson 2, page 3 titled., I will not be covering this in lesson. \r\nThis issue makes me wonder if the teachers are even looking at the assessments. Another example Math 3B, Unit 2, lesson 1 is a practice review of basically improper fractions. Improper fractions were brought up briefly in the online lesson. I was shocked at the review because the problems did not even compare to the 2 examples given in the lesson. When I asked the teacher about it she had to look at the practice review to see what I was talking about. She was shocked that is what the practice review was on. Why are the teachers not going through the lesson assessments to see what the questions are? They are the teachers; it is their job to know what our students are being graded on. I cant tell you how many times I have had to go back to a teacher and ask, Why was this not addressed in class? Improper fractions are a big deal for 3rd grade. \r\n\r\nLike I said, I am overall please with CCA but there are a few things that need improved to make the students lessons time efficient. I wasted 20 minutes today trying to figure out why my daughter couldnt answer assessment questions on editorials only to find that her teacher never covered the topic. \r\n","Overall our experience with CCA has been great. I am glad that we broke from Connections Education to make changes that will help our students become better learners. Thank you! I am looking forward to a new LMS, I find the Connexus system time consuming and frustrating. It takes multiple clicks to get a desired location.

When I first started out in this world of homeschooling with a cyber school, PA Cyber had 2 choices of curriculum to choose from. And, my local school district actually also offers K12 and Connections as 2 choices for curriculum. However, they weren't as connected as CCA has been with the staff and contact-ease, so that is why we have stayed with CCA. I would LOVE to have this same communication with the teachers, but use the K12 program and a supplemental program for Microsoft software. Making the music optional would be even more perfect as I absolutely think there could be MANY changes to the songs and the programming for that part of the K12 curriculum. Just simply placing the ability to make the songs slower would help teach the sounds and theory that they are trying to teach. If you would like to talk more with me about my opinions, I could talk forever about things I would love to see in a curriculum.

Please contact me if you wish. 717-859-3193 Jaclyn","Well, I said quite a bit in the last question. I would mention that the classes with the teachers take up a lot of time with the kids and my son especially, in 8th grade, hasn't always had enough time to get all his work done. I think it's important to make those classes solely content based. I have heard that they are that way in high school, but I don't understand why they wouldn't be that way in Middle School as well. I think that some students can handle the work load after classes (my daughter being one of the them), but other students (like my 8th grade son) can not and it's a struggle sometimes to keep him caught up with his planner lessons when he has class several hours a day on other points of interest other than the content.\r\n\r\nThe other thing I feel like I need to mention is that I don't understand why my kids learn the same thing every year in Science especially. Several times this year, my 4th, 6th and 8th grader were all working on the same thing. Now, of course, the information was a little different comparing the grades, but initially it looks like they are always learning the same things. There is a lot of science in the world. I would have thought that the curriculum writers could come up with other things to teach our children. Instead, it sometimes appears that the curriculum is the same, but with additions for the older grades. It just comes across as lazy. Sorry to be blunt, but that was my first thought when we started seeing this trend the first year we started. I do wish there was more to the science curriculum.

The flexibility and support that CCA provides allows my family to be active in my daughter's education and provide for our son.

We are confident that our children will excel at this school.",null,null,"I am overall satisfied with my experience with CCA.  I love the curriculum, flexibility and overall experiences.

The class field trips are always too far away and a VERY expensive trip. The programs given to kids with special needs do not actually help, they create new issues to over come and are very hit and miss in being effective. Co-writer does not work they way it is stated and doesn't help students that need it. It cannot be used in programs the kids need it for with assignments.  Virtual OT is not very effective. Tech support needs to be more helpful and a lot quicker so they kids don't fall behind.","CCA is a great schooling.  The staff have had the past few years until now have been great.

Although, I realize this is an expense for the school, for the students who attend live lessons regularly, write bills, travel to conventions as required, keep the required grade point average, prepare briefs and spend a whole weekend at Model, they deserve the school to fund it.  Their families should not have to give up the community class reimbursement.  For meaningful instrumental experiences the school should get memberships in musical education groups like LLMEA, where students can prepare challenging pieces and competitively audition to be a member of regional orchestras, working their way up as far as Nationals.  The school might have expense if a student was talented enough, but there would also be exposure for the school, in the programs and the media.","We love CCA.  Our kids talk to everyone about how they love their school and the way they are educated online.

They go above and beyond to offer help to student in need. They answer questions and encourage students to seek help even if it is just for something small.

Our son has learned so much more at this school then at his brick and morter school.","I wish the principles would be better at communication. This year 1 of my kids had a pregnant teacher leave in November and we were left in the dark about what would happen to us until after she left. We had no teacher for a few days. It was frustrating to deal with. In a brick and mortar school, parents would have been informed of what was happening and no students would be left alone without a teacher. Also, my other student met her \"gifted\" teacher last year online in a meet n greet. In August she was assigned that teacher and then all of a sudden, it disappeared from her list. For several weeks she had no teacher. Luckily she finally got a new teacher but not until after school was already in session. The principle should have emailed all of these new students and told us what was going on. While we didn't need to know if the teacher left or was being reassigned, we needed to know that \"Hey, we are making changes and please be patient with us.\" Since we have no control over the times of our kids online teachers lessons (teachers choice) we should be informed as soon as possible to make our own plans. With having 2 kids and different schedules, I need to know the times of classes. If one class is in the late afternoon, I may not be able to work as early as I would like at my nighttime job. My kids education comes first, but I have a job that needs to know my schedule. I have kids activities that need to be registered for or they will lose their spots in August. The sooner we can get the live lessons times the better. A quick email is all I need to show me that we are valued and not being overlooked.","The teachers are awesome! They are responsive and engage the kids during live lesson. The field trips are wonderful. We have experienced so many new things. The free trips have been incredible learning experiences. My kids love the CCA bus and experiments. Meet the teachers in school is so important for a better connection. I really wish this could happen sooner in the school year. We couldn't make any teacher field trips this year, but we did see them at the Andreas office. It would be great to have this in the beginning of the year.",null,null,"We have been completely satisfied with our daughter's high school education at CCA.  Our eldest son graduated from CCA last school year, and they have both received an exemplary education.

My daughter is an only child and I work during the day so I am not able to take her to the activities that are offered.  This has led to too much social isolation.  Many of the subjects seemed to be \"watered down\" and alot of \"spoon feeding\".  She did enjoy her Honors courses and found them more challenging.  Her science teacher was excellent and made his class an interesting environment to learn in.  She learned a lot in Spanish about the language; although, the teacher did not cover culture even though it is tested.","Like i said to many portfolios",null,"My child has asked multiple times this year for help from teachers and has not gotten the help!

This is something our public schools could not offer.","It has been a good experience for this child.  She has had a medically challenging year, and CCA enabled her to be able to keep taking classes while getting the treatment she needed.","I feel like the teachers and staff at CCA accept my child for who he is and are not trying to fit him into some type of model they want to teach to.   As a learning coach, it is so valuable to be able to access all information at anytime, and be able to see exactly what my child needs to be doing.  At a regular school, this would be virtually impossible and is one of the main reasons we came to CCA.",null,null,null,null,"There should be and more extensive system in place to reach out to families that have different needs. I have more to say but this page keeps crashing.","CCA has been a good option for us.  We have four children, three of whom have enjoyed their public school education.  CCA was a lifesaver for our one child for whom public school was not fitting the bill.  The biggest missing link has been the lack of social interaction with other students.  We found attending a few meet and greets and a spring social was not a way to connect with other students.  We felt there was no easy way to break in to the groups or connect with others who weren't already in groups.  This has been my experience with a student starting in October of their sophomore year.","I just want to say thank you for everything you have done.",null,"We have been with CCA 4 years now, since Kindergarten. This year was the most disappointing. We feel CCA was stronger in previous years. The iready tests are a huge source of discontentment.",null,null,"Overall the experience has been positive but the supplemental classes for kids with learning disabilities need to be more specific. If the child needs help with spelling provide help with spelling and don't just put them in a program that is not specifically targeting spelling issues.","CCA is such a wonderful school.  I have gotten a lot of negative feedback from therapists that work with my son, who has Autism, but the field trip opportunities and the networking through Family Mentor meet-ups allows him the socialization he doesn't get in a brick and mortar school.","Our experience has been mostly positive. I enjoy the program and I hope that it only gets better as the school transitions next year.","N/A",null,"Great program great teachers great staff","It has been great so far.","I am so thankful that I found your school for my child.  She loves it, and so do I.","I think at least 5 CCA English teachers one in each office needs to be trained in Lindamood Bell Visualizing /Verbalizing for reading comprehension. There is a very few proven reading programs available for reading comprehension that work. Or a CCA reading comprehension intensive in Lindamood Bell V/V over the summer at each office. It is not expensive to train a teacher (under $1,000 for each program and multiple students could benefit from small group). To send one student to a Lindamood Bell office is $25,000/student to receive the intervention. They can charge this price because it is one of the only intervention that works.

There were always kids starting fights and bullying others. My son started to hate school. I wasn't sure what to expect at CCA but soon realized that the curriculum is great, the teachers always answer emails and calls, are always available to help if it is needed, and while there are time lines, he can work at a pace that isn't too strict. There is also tons of help available for parents if needed, but being a learning coach is nowhere near as hard as I thought it would be. I have nothing bad to say about CCA and I am very thankful it was available, because without it, my son probably would have dropped out of school. Instead, he is graduating with a 3.96 GPA and going off to Penn State. Thank you CCA.","My experience with CCA is the constant consistency you have dealing with teachers, administration and technical support.  I have always for the past five years watched recordings and of course, read emails to get a feel of all my child's teachers. Every teacher has shown great support and warmth towards students to help them reach their goals. I also, like  Dr. Flurie's video updates, it is nice to put a face to a name and for him to take the time to share updates with us; this completes the overall picture of the school's willingness to be successful with education for all student enrolled at CCA.","More assistance","Excellent!

We were very skeptical about our daughter doing her school work from home. We heard all the horror stories and very few success stories so, of course we were very uncomfortable about this choice to go cyber. There were many other reasons as well. All the trouble we were having at the time with our daughter in an alternative school, made going cyber harder but our only choice. Honestly we were at our wits end when we decided that cyber school was our last hope for our daughter to get an education and we where not sure if the education she was going to receive was going to be grade level. She wasn't getting her grade level of education either. Our daughter has thought long and hard about what she want's to do with her life after high school and that require's her to go to a four year college to be able to get into the carrier of her choice. After talking with a lot of the faculty, researching CCA and comparing CCA to other cyber school's we started to become comfortable with the idea of home schooling. Well I can say I did not expect all that CCA has to offer. The resources and strive for higher education is remarkable, and the education that she is getting is fantastic. Our daughter thought she wasn't smart enough to return to what she called a normal education but, once she became comfortable with everything she realized that she was just as normal as anyone else. Thanks to CCA our daughter's future not just in her eyes, but in our eyes as well, looks to be a hole lot brighter. We can't thank the faculty and staff of CCA enough.

When we've had doctors appointments or even field trips my son falls so far behind way too quickly and it takes him weeks to catch up again from one day off.  We aren't doing any more field trips this school year because of the heavy workload &amp; LL schedule. Also, CCA added PE to his spring schedule without okaying it with us &amp; it is a ton of extra work for a silly PE credit. Oh and changed his Health teacher without our say and now he has much worse health teacher. \r\nOn the positive side we love many of his teachers. Mrs. Bernstein for algebra A++. Mr Mariano for biology a++. Mrs. Schmidt for English A++. Mr conigliaro for history is excellent teacher but he gets frustrated with the kids and gets very negative &amp; judgemental. While my child has not been the object of his negative remarks some of it could be humiliating for the kids who it is directed at. Plus he doesn't send emails to parents just kids so I cannot keep track of changes &amp; announcements. Then he gets upset with students for not following directions &amp; reading his emails, etc. \r\nOverall it's CCA is inconsistent. Yes it has great teachers. Curriculum has way too much meaningless busy work. The CCA office staff are hit or miss. Some staff are great while others don't answer emails or have sub par communication skills on phone. Most times I have to be the one remember to follow up about unanswered emails &amp; issues.

I was surprised that two teachers just sat sharing youtube videos. I am a dancer myself so it wasn't what we expected. That's OK, but I think the name should be reconsidered. I felt our teacher was very condescending at times. If she expects me to call her MISS in one on one interactions I expect the same courtesy. During testing times I think the offer of a visit to a local office should be suggested to inner city families who don't drive. We had zero connection with any of the children in our son's class. Maybe a fun cam session would be good? Informal and get to know you. We loved Ms. Stevenson and her class on social interaction. However, we just found out about it two weeks ago. I think the lessons could be more fluid. For example, we had a project about making a spring cultural twig to be put outside March 1. But the lesson is in January. There was a lesson on the olden days and on the next page after the intro there was a photo discussion of a little girl falling down on ice skates. I think your topics are great, but the fluidity is off. I was disappointed that during an election year the voting process was almost entirely ignored. It can be done in a neutral, non-biased way. Nickelodeon's website was great for inspiration. Thank you for hearing my concerns.

Also, please stop the Common Core Curriculum.  It is detrimental to our children.  School should be fun and not robotic and tortuous.

The curriculum requirements have become excessive - too many Live Lessons, too many portfolios, too many assignments to complete.

There was so much more flexibility and the work load was manageable.  The Calvert Curriculum was superior to the Pearson Curriculum, in our opinion.

The curriculum should be revised and revamped and the students should not have to put in more than 6 hours to complete their workload and maintain excellent grades.  The workload is oppressive and ridiculous and our family is not too happy at this point.

If there is an issue with a therapist its taken care of, someone is always around to help or answer my questions.  Heather Rowles this year is our learning support teacher and I cannot say enough positive things about her.  How fast she got to learn what works for my daughter, how to talk to her, what else we needed.  She is amazing.  But so are all of her teachers this year and for the most part since we have started.

They should also highlight their curriculum grading especially when it is outside the norm like the Spanish class. Most classes on average have 3 portfolios per semester, so they should be emphasizing these sorts of things so the students get the importance of a particular assignment.  And when students are reaching out they should demonstrate a greater measure of connecting with the student.  I was thoroughly disappointed with Mrs. Bueno and the way she was so passive and really missed an opportunity to serve my daughter.  I would want her superior to get this message and help her to explain at the beginning of class as well as during the class that goes over the portfolio that it is the only one and that it carries a lot of weight.  Most likely whatever you get on the portfolio will end up being the grade.  She never did this during any of her classes and I think it puts the student at a disadvantage especially since there is only one portfolio assignment.",null,"My one disappointment with the curriculum would be the lack of reading classic literature/full books rather than selections.  I understand that their independent reading selections are supposed to substitute for that lack, but I do wish there was more class time interaction/writing and engagement with good books and that the curriculum itself would provide more of those classics as part of their core.","I think CCA does and excellent job for special education children and think this is a population in PA that thrives with cyber education.  I am a strong advocate for your programs. Thank-you",null,null,"CCA has been a wonderful change from the public school system for our son.  He spent the first 7 years in public school and each year got progressively more stressful and challenging.  Since making the switch to CCA, it has gotten progressively less stressful.  The CCA staff has taken more interest and been more engaged with our son in a year and a half than we ever saw with the public school system.  They didn't seem to care nor try to understand, whereas CCA did.

It would be nice to know that we have nothing to worry about. Even if tuition was an option, is there anything we can do to ensure our children that their school is not going to be pulled out from under them?

We can not thank you enough for this opportunity! \r\nI hope that you read my thoughts on the previous page. \r\nThanks!",null,"I truly love CCA. We miss the flied trips we took last year but we understand the funding situation. CCA has friendly, caring staff members who seem to fill the missing gap that the regular schools was lacking. The teacher understand that every child has different situation and learning curves.","I think thought should be given to the art and technology courses. I do not think they should be dropped, just adjusted.  Art should be more age appropriate and open book.  It's so dry and dull, it's actually turned my art loving kids away from art.  They want nothing to do with it.  And technology has so much duplicate LA and math works as to be completely labor intensive.  I create simple tech \"assignments\" in their place in minutes that make more sense and are less time eaters.  Kids enjoy my lessons, but hate the school lessons.  But I do see the value in having technology and am glad it is a regular class.  You may consider letting student take every other year though after their first year, as it is quite repetitive.\r\n\r\nI do like the school quite a bit, it's just that as a learning coach to three, two with special needs, I am tied to the classroom for about 10 hours a day, sometimes much longer.  I am either making the lessons approachable or teaching my older child skills that are supose to be addressed through an IEP.  It is much more than a single person can do and I'm not sure how much longer I can do it.  The school should be taking some responsibility and they are not.","I've shared my thoughts with quite a number of people including the CEO.  It's up to you to do something about it now.

Her performance in the upcoming SAT and ACT tests will greatly influence our opinion of CCA. Stay tuned...",null,"The teachers need to be on the same page as the school and the kids (different policies for the same thing for instance). We found this year (possibly due to the growth and the break from Connections Academy), a bit more challenging that in past years. Mostly due to what the teachers are expecting. In the 7th grade, some teachers do NOT want to you to work ahead and you (ie my student) have to really pay attention to what the teachers are saying as you get docked for doing the work ahead of time or miss out on the changes (changes aren't announced until LL and then not updated on the BB or within the lesson). It makes working independently difficult and that is one of the draws to CCA. Also I have found that my son (2nd) has a different teacher for math than the other and communication with her is non-existent. Fortunately he is strong in math but there are a few times where it would have been nice to be able to contact her.","This is my answer to the prior question but it applies here more...In our case CCA was exactly what we needed to get our daughter through High School. We started in 10th grade and our experience was very positive. I did partner with a tutor to aid me as my daughter's learning coach, which was not required. We were quite pleased with the curriculum and the fact that she was accepted into 3 universities (the honors program in 1) is a testament to its strength.","Overall, great job, I don't know what we would have done without CCA the past 8 years!!",null,"We LOVE CCA but have been having many issues the past 2 years, primarily with teacher responsiveness.",null,"The staff and administrators are wonderful and are willing to give their all to help the students succeed in life.

The families that I mentor have said or have done the following:  At the GS sessions, they are presented too much information at once.  They feel overwhelmed and they do not remember what is being said.  (The CCA How To Guide should be given out at the GS sessions)  Many CTs have a false sense of \"knowing everything\" and are not open to help or advise.  Many do not go to LL, communicate with teachers or Family Mentors.  Often, they call me up in a panic when they are in alarm or being kicked out of CCA.","Some of the teachers need to be friendlier at Field Trips and school events.  Some teachers need to post their LL schedule and have it coordinate with the lessons better. We need a branch office in the Lehigh Valley.  We need more field trips and social events.

Many of them are still clueless after going to the Great Start Sessions or are getting misinformation there.  It has been more work this year to get new families started and understanding that they have to be an active participant in their child's education. They are under the impression that they just can stick their child in front of the computer.

We have had mostly good teachers and a few excellent ones.  We have found most teachers easy to work with.  The work is rigorous and balancing live lessons and the daily coursework is challenging.  In the first year my student attended all the live lessons and much less now.  I've also noticed that live lessons have gotten longer, a full hour.  I think 30-40 minutes or less is plenty, and more students might attend.  The prospect of having 5 1-hour live lessons in a day means the student has no time left to get any other course work done.  The choice to go back to the public school was based on the need to have more interaction with students his age, and not on academics.","CCA has a high quality of wonderful teachers and staff.

It's a great facility but underutilized for the students and families. Just even simple things like a weekly board game day for the kids to socialize, or movie nights such as the ones offered in the Harrisburg office. The pond outside could be used for pond studies, etc. Again, these activities don't have to be elaborate or costly, but opportunities for our students to work and play together. We'd also like to see the paid field trips, with spaces available at the time of the outing, opened to families that may have already attended their one monthly paid field trip. This year, many field trips have been under attended, or even cancelled, due to lack of sign up, when there are families that would be glad to assume the cost and go. Our CCA experience was better when we could attend more field trips. Our student saw her schoolmates more frequently and benefitted from the varied field trip experiences. Additionally, there need to be more free field trips and meet-ups. Utilizing the Andreas facility could be one solution to the need for increased free social and academic field days.",null,null,"n/a","For our child, one of five, cyber school was the perfect fit","I am very pleased with his education. He has an IEP and gets the services he needs as well. The curriculum is first class.

Thank you for that!!!","said it all.","we are very happy what CCA has provided for our daughter and our family.","I would like to recognize the 7th grade blue team teachers. They are a fantastic group of educators.","I wrote it all in the last box. Have one 2012 Grad with CCA, one Grad for 2016 with CCA and hopefully our last child will graduate in 2021 with Connections Academy.","We really enjoy the field trips.  I was disappointed as to how they were handled this year.  I would like to be able to have my child attend more paid field trips than 1 per month, even if I have to pay out of pocket for the additional trips.  Socialization is very important.  Cutting back on the trips has made this an issue.  I also think that there should be more review incorporated in the lessons.  I love the curriculum, but I sometimes feel that it is too fast, and the students are not retaining information because of this.  I am impressed with the curriculum.  When we chose an online school, I thought I would have to supplement the curriculum, but that isn't the case with CCA.","CCA has been a saint for us. Our daughter was not responding well to Math in her brick and mortar school.  She loved her friends and the socialization of brick and mortar schools however she was failing math but excelled in all other subjects. We were told continuously that we should consider holding her back a grade because of her math skills yet she excelled in everything else. After sitting with the Principal, Guidance Counselor and Teacher, we discussed holding her back and the possibility of putting her on ADD medication. I was furious yet stayed composed and explained that ADD medicine is for children/adults that have difficulties paying attention, not for the lack of understanding in one subject.  That would hardly be a reason to put a child on ADD medicine. After that meeting, I informed the school, that we would be showing her how to compete math the way she comprehends it. She was doing this before and getting the answers correct however since it was different from the way the curriculum showed to get the answer, the teachers were marking them incorrect. She obviously learns differently in math than how they were teaching yet was getting the same (correct) answer. After this continued and the constant communication that we should consider holding her back so that she can repeat and understand math better, we began looking for alternatives. We found many different charter and virtual schools however CCA stood out to us by a long shot. We enrolled her and her younger brother in CCA, after extensive research, and she has excelled ever since.  She made honor roll within her first year of school and has been \"on top of the world\" ever since. She still has difficulties in math however with the extra math help provided by CCA, taped live lessons that she can re-watch in the areas she finds more difficult and wonderful assistance from the teachers, she maintains a B average in math alone. All other courses she is A and A+. She and we, as parents, couldn't be more proud of her and her development. I know everyday my children are safe, respectful, confident, intelligent and have the best support from CCA that they need for their future. Had it not been for the guidance and support of CCA, my daughter would most likely have been put on anti-depressants for a lack of self-esteem and depression, ADD medications because they felt she wasn't paying attention and held back a grade. \r\n\r\nMy husband and I laugh sometimes at others that tell us \"you are ruining your children's future by putting them in charter schools\". We simply reply, \"if ruining our children's lives by providing them the best education, support, guidance, opportunities for Division I colleges/universities all while building a strong foundation, confidence within themselves is ruining their lives, then we are comfortable with that. Our children's curriculum is more difficult and intense than the average brick and mortar school yet our children now excel in all of their courses. Not because they're easier, to the contrary, but because they have the ability to review what they need to work on and quickly go through what they already know. They have teachers that are available to help them understand the questions, not push them through because it may hold up the class. Ruining our children's lives would have been ignoring the issues, like so many do, and followed what everyone thought was the right way to educate because that's the way it's always been done.  Virtual schools are the way of the future, it's why universities are offering so many classes virtually. Our children will be more ready for their future because of what they have learned at CCA and been instilled with from a moral and respectful home.\"\r\n\r\nSo in summary, thank you CCA. Thank you for allowing my daughter to be the confident, beautiful, intelligent and strong child she always has been. She glows everyday with happiness and walks tall due to her grades and positive responses from her teachers. Her younger brother sees this everyday and wants to walks in those same footprints of a proud sibling.

I have called multiple times about it but nothing is ever done to fix it.  I was told they know this is a problem and are working on it.  It is not encouraging to see a big, mean, frowning face everyday that you log in, knowing full well your child has been working and gets good grades.

Yeah, there are still days when it gets frustrating or upsetting, but they sure do get excited when they see great grades. Both children have an overall average of a B - one low, one high.

Our CCA grad of 2013, our daughter Sarah, went on to complete Escoffier Online Culinary Institute without a problem. She is certified in Culinary Arts and Baking/Pastry. She found the switch from CCA to another online school easy. Zechariah was at CCA from grades 6-8. However, he had to go into the brick school for high school, due to the very active daily music schedule at that high school. He always said that CCA did well in teaching him the 5 paragraph - essay format. He found writing to be no trouble in high school, taking that knowledge with him. He is currently a scholarship student at Moravian College, majoring in Music Tech/Audio Recording/Jazz Sax and possibly accounting or business. \r\nWe are a fan of CCA and continue to be so.

I'd like to see her be able to go faster in the areas she feels she excels in and likes (like math) as she has expressed wanting to do so.  She LOVES learning Sign Language.  She didn't like Elementary Spanish as much because while she wanted to learn the language, she didn't want to have to learn history and culture in the same class.  (She already takes Social Studies and it is not her favorite.)  I think You should break out the culture of Spain and Spanish speaking countries from learning the language.  Because of this mix, she does not want to take the next class in Spanish, which is unfortunate because at some point (later), I will possibly have to insist she learn Spanish.  Hopefully later there will be language learning separate from history/culture.

It is my opinion that the 5th grade curriculum was easier than the 4th grade curriculum.  The curriculum should be getting more difficult to prepare students for Middle School and High School not easier.   My son was often bored this past year.   When looking into the gifted program for him I found that is wasn't more enriching. It was only more busy work.  The gifted math program only skips the student ahead a year in math.  How can you skip a whole year of Math? Math builds on prior knowledge.   These are areas that I think CCA needs to improve upon.    Also, most or the teachers we have had with CCA have been excellent.  They have always exceeded our expectations.  However this year my son's Science/SS teacher left us feeling frustrated.  He did the bare minimum that was required of him.  His live lessons consisted of showing the videos that were already in the lessons.  His reviews were copied from somewhere else and often didn't even coincide with the curriculum.    It seemed like his heart was not in teaching.  I look at a teacher as a service industry.  They are helping to shape our future.  If a teacher is not interested in inspiring and helping students learn then teaching is not the right profession for them in my opinion.       All this being said,  CCA has been a wonderful experience for my son before this point.  I really appreciate the flexibility and the opportunities that is gives students.  It teaches students to be free thinking citizens instead of just learning for a test.  CCA allows students to grow both academically and as a person.","CCA lacks SUPPORT, COMMUNICATION, and EDUCATION. Don't ignore.  The quality of the curriculum has tanked. Too many errors in lessons.

It turned his life around as far as how he felt about school. His old school, although I am told it is a good school, was far from student oriented. They seemed to allow the kids to take over and it wasn't about the learning anymore. They just passed the kids through never noticing who was struggling or who may have been in crisis. I love that this school puts all the kids on even footing. There are no \"cliques\" to contend with, that gets in the way of learning. My son was an A student until high school and his school paid no notice that his grades were slipping. No one asked why? We found CCA and he immediately thrived. He still has all his school friends and he is very well rounded, just now he can focus on himself and not all the petty bologna that goes on in a school that is out of control. From the first day CCA has caught hi attention. He has no trouble with the lessons and can work on his own or ask for help from anyone of his teachers. They are all willing to help. And by the way they all have the best attitudes and personalities. He is going to graduate in June and I know when he walks up to get his diploma he will be proud to say he graduated from CCA. So will his Father and myself. By the way I tell all my friends to check out your school, especially if their child is having any issues with the brick and mortar school they attend. From a learning coach point of view, this has been a great experience for myself as well. I have been so proud and honored that he turns to me to help him if he has a question about his assignments. All in all we give the CCA experience an A+.\r\n","It's excellent. I recommend CCA to so many people. We enrolled for the second semester in 8th grade (my son is now in 10th).

The Snap and Read Universal program that helps read his lessons to him has created an independent work atmosphere for him to step out on his own.

At the same time, CCA provides a comprehensive support system of parents, teachers, administrators, and other staff who ensure that the learning coaches are never alone and the students are never isolated.

The curriculum is great and all my child wants to do is school. His grades are awesome, too. The curriculum provided at the prior school was atrocious!! However, the teacher's learning styles and methods here are fitting for almost every learning style/s and I think that is important for students here (especially ones with special needs, because they use Cyber School and require exceptional accommodation).

Not satisfied w/ rate of communication received from HS teachers. Last yr, MS team was VERY responsive. I believe they should pride themselves on that! They responded to WebMails promptly, answered calls, and updated students  w/ needed info. This yr, that responsiveness really lacked in the HS team of teachers. The HS teachers are not the best at answering phone calls and WebMails (same w/ HS administration). Been times where my son has sent a WebMail to one of his teachers and it took them a wk to respond, while some of them dont answer at all. Hard to reach the teachers by phone too. Disappointed, as last yr was quite the contrary! Teachers were good at letting the kiddos know about whats going on. Student is expected to keep an open line of communication and teachers seem to have lacked that yr. Would really encourage teachers were better trained on grading. Understood grading styles vary, but sometimes its just ridiculous. Some teachers create their own expectations for assessments, but when you read how they graded my sons work and compare it to the expectations outlined, its clear that his work wasnt even compared to the expectations. PLEASE encourage the teachers to make a CLEAR grading rubric for their assessments and FOLLOW IT for each assessment. Also, some teachers dont understand circumstances my son has been in. Some seem to forget that we are real people and have real lives and stuff happens that doesnt always let us stay on top of all the work and consequently not letting us do everything as well as expected. Have suffered deaths in the family and have been expected to continue working as normal. In B&amp;M school, a student would be excused from work that he missed in class (I know as I have a son in B&amp;M school excused of work when he was at a funeral).

Although both students are in different schools they have the same curriculum provider, the student in your school can actually read better then her older sibling, she can answer more Science and SS questions then her sibling.

We also love how the teachers in the 6th grade have moved away from using textbooks while teaching and have provided all the teaching a student needs to go right from Live Lesson to an assessment; especially with Mr. Bennett in Math; his way of teaching math is so effective.

The first year we started we went on at least 5 the whole school year. Now we get it is full and put on a waiting list. We joined this school because there were field so we could meet other people.","No one did anything at all with my son's IEP services until February. There was no Learning Support teacher in the fall assigned to my son. The next Learning Support teacher wrote an IEP with blank spaces for goals. We finally got a Reading teacher doing the Rewards program twice a week with my son which started a few weeks ago.\r\nAside from that, my son loves the teachers and kids. He has had a wonderful time on the educational field trips. He greatly enjoys the flexible schedule and feels much more relaxed in this type of learning environment. He has said that he feels he has learned so much more than he did in the public school.","So far, this has been a great source to teach my child while keeping them home.","TEACHERS CARE AND ARE FRIENDLY.","My 4th child is in the sync program and is going to be going to middle school next year.  I dearly wish that there could be some sort of sync program offered in middle school.  He has excelled with this program this year and last.  If he is too challenged, he becomes frustrated and shuts down.  At the same time, I didn't want him to not grow and learn.  Sync has been perfect.  Next year, I am truly worried about how he will do.  Like I said, he shuts down when he becomes frustrated and if he doesn't understand something, he gets frustrated.  A lot of the concepts, and the pace of the curriculum, I am afraid might be too much.  We have decided to give it a shot and see how things go, and if we hit problems, I will definitely be reaching out, but I really wish there was something like sync in the middle school.  It has been an amazing program!",null,"When the teachers see someone failing it would be nice for them to offer some help to the ones having trouble.","We like CCA.  We especially like the live lessons.  They are very helpful.  Although we have never used the after school program, it is nice to know that it is available as well.

We really appreciate your support since we are a missionary family.  CCA has helped us to give our son a consistent education as we travel and give him a diverse international education.",null,"I work full time and I am unavailable for phone calls during the day.  I find that many teachers are unwilling to make adjustments such as communicating via webmail.  I would also like to see the ability for children to turn in portfolios/discussions and other types of assignments out of order.  I understand quizzes and tests need to be done in order, but many of the other assessments require some extra guidance by the learning coach. When that extra guidance isn't immediately available to the student, they cannot move on without submitting these.  I think they should be able to move to the next lesson and maybe just have a certain window of time in which these need to be turned in.","I think the field trip planners have to large of areas. This is a problem for my family, as we live far away from any big cities. I see that more populated areas always have a lot of things going on for the students to get together. But up north here, there are very few activities to meet other families. I understand this is because of the rural area we live in, but it is a major issue for those of us in this situation. It would be nice if CCA was at least able to somehow \"Connect the Families\" in these area. Since it is optional to be put on the mailing or location information, there may be other families around me that I don't even know about.","I love this school everything about it I am very satisfied with my experience at this school.

The almost immediate response from all of the staff when we have questions is such a help. We have never waited more than an hour for a response.

He has a reading specialist twice/week for reading improvement, but it would be very helpful if others would help him read the lessons.",null,"Over all I really love this school. I wish more people went to CCA.","My experience with CCA has been great the way everyone works to make sure the student and the coach are doing well with everything , and they keep in contact with the coach and student to make sure every thing is going good and you understand what we have to do.","The experience overall is good.","In our first year with CCA, we had difficulty with one teacher.  She was not helpful.  She would not explain her reasoning for grades she gave.  My child could not grow, nor learn, and ended up distrusting every teacher in that subject each year afterwards.  This year he finally got over that...pretty much anyhow.  That teacher did call me at the end of that school year, apologized and said she hoped we would return the following year.  We have no ill thoughts toward her and hold no bitterness.  I have seen her a few times since, and we have had good conversations.  It was just very unfortunate and I hope she has developed better communication with her students.  I began this survey with, Once upon a time... We continue to live happily ever after with CCA as our school.  The End. :)","I really cannot complain.   CCA has always been a very positive experience for our family and the best learning option I've come across so far.  My child enjoys school now, but never really liked the traditional brick and mortar school setting.","We've had one English teacher new to CCA this year(2017) who is very unspecific with instructions and when asked via Web-mail she didn't respond.   Following some other misunderstanding of poorly worded instructions she was quite \"snarky\" on a phone call.   I've also spoken with other parents  who have had the same experience with this teacher.   She was however, a bit better with the last phone call.  She has marked/taken points away on assignments, when I feel she should not have since her instructions were not clear.   She took away points for not citing a paper that was cited. Again, we were not the only family she did this to.   She also took points away for not using \"transition words\" in essays when indeed transition words were used.   Again, we were not the only family she did this to.   I have spoken with other parents who students have her as their teacher.",null,null,null,"There's alot. See that note.",null,"Staff and teachers are kind and helpful","Thank you for making this experience possible!","I had a small problem with one teacher not getting back to me.    I can understand being busy, but I feel it is very important that a teacher respond to a parent within 24 hours.  If a question is asked of a teacher and the teacher is not sure how to answer it, I recommend  that  a teacher should acknowledge the parents concern and get back to them later.   I also have an issue with not having quizzes, test and portfolios graded in a timely manner.  Some times weeks, or , for a portfolio, a month.  Granted, I know that teachers are busy and this was my experience with ONE teacher.   I the issue was discussed with  a principle and is now in their hands.  All in All I am very satisfied with my experience with CCA.","Our son has excelled since starting a Cyber program in 2014 both before and now with CCA.  We originally wanted to go with CCA however to keep enrolled in Vo-Tech we had to use another Cyber.  CCA provides more structure and hands on learning than the other Cyber.  The old school district just didn't seem to want to adapt to our son's learning ability, teachers just to set in there own ways of doing things.  Were very satisfied and glad to be part of CCA and thank you for allowing us to be a part.",null,"Again, the satisfaction we have found with CCA has been because of some terrific teachers our child has worked with.\r\n\r\nWhat needs improvement? Last year our child was working in a curriculum that everyone knew was truly terrible- sometimes too easy, or too difficult, information that was completely useless and random. Instead of being upfront , we were sold a bill of goods about the curriculum. This year, surprise , it is gone. Own up to mistakes. We parents can always work with that kind of honesty.","Overall we had an excellent experience and thank you for your excellence.  We decided to place him in a \"regular\" school for 9th grade and high school primarily due to the social environment.",null,null,"thank you for the opportunity to experience learning this year at CCA. Appreciated greatly :)",null,"Overall our experience with CCA has been wonderful and my son has had less stress on him now that he is not rushed through his courses and we feel he is getting more out of his education than his standard traditional school.","This is my child's first year in CCA and both her and I are extremely happy that we came to CCA for her schooling. I'd recommend CCA to everyone that's looking to have their child to do online schooling.","Honestly, we love CCA and tell all of our friends what a phenomenal service you provide.

Keep up the great work:)",null,null,null,"I like the fact that my son was immediately set up with an IEP when he enrolled, and anything else that was needed to enable him towards being successful in life.",null,null,"One thing that is challenging is what to do with students who finish their lessons before the 28 required hours. If we encourage our students to work ahead, it makes the live lessons obsolete for them as they are ahead of the lesson. If we don't encourage them to work ahead, they are bored and we find ourselves simply \"filling time\" to make up the 28 required hours. It seems to me that if a student is getting straight A's in their classes, that the hour requirement should be removed (yes, I know this is a state requirement, but it's still frustrating).\r\n\r\nI think that teachers should NOT be allowed to give extra credit to students.\r\n\r\nWe have appreciated how some teachers allow our students to correct missed problems on tests/quizzes and earn back some of the points missed.","I was worried at first about the transition to online course work but my child really enjoys the live lessons and feels connected to his teachers, they are a wonderful group of people. It has been a wonderful experience.","PLEASE COMMEND ALL TEACHERS OF THE PURPLE 6TH GRADE TEAM THIS YEAR. We would have left, if it had not been for such outstanding teachers. More than being outstanding, they have been caring- caring about my child as a person and her quality of education. MANY THANKS!","I love CCA and the teachers we have had. But the curriculum for first grade is a little too much. My daughter struggles with reading and I love that there are programs like I-ready and reading eggs but the other subjects especially the portfolios makes it hard to concentrate on just reading. Some of the portfolios seem like a bit much for a first grader, like the one we recently did in social studies where she had to draw/make a medal and then write basically a short essay (introductory sentence, body sentences, and a closing sentence). I understand wanting to introduce them to this but when a kid is struggling with reading and writing this definitely doesn't help. Also some of the science portfolios can be a lot too. I feel like this year hasn't been much help. Yes she's learned a lot but it seems like it's not much when it comes to needing to pass the grade.","Excellent!!","We really appreciate all of the help Mr. Kyle Chuff has provided to us and our child this year.  \r\nThe teachers we have had are very good.

My daughter has been very happy.  To me, the teachers are human, not a machine like public schools.  Most of the teachers in public schools are mean, nasty, and don't want to help students who are having trouble.  Seems like they just don't care anymore.  The CCA teachers are exactly the opposite.

CCA typically has wonderful teachers, but this one in particular is lacking, and I don't see that anything is ever addressed, which is why I mentioned little to no oversight.

I don't remember exactly how many pages but at least 5 pages with just 2 lessons to get it done in. \r\n\r\n5th grade - huge SS portfolio, on top of a bunch of LA writing portfolios, on top of a book report, don't you think that's too much?  \r\n\r\n4th and 5th grade - why can't some of the portfolios just be worksheet pages or something a little simpler. I think some writing is good not so much. I also think there could be better science experiments. Our latest one 5th grade one was freezing water to see which freezes faster cold or hot. It took over 3 hours to get the water to freeze. My daughter had to check it every 10 minutes. Then repeat it 2 more times!! That's just crazy.

In fact, I feel like I can't get my child to take some of the opportunities available that they should. We love CCA. A little more peer pressure in the good ways, from teachers would be helpful. My teen always responds to the teachers well on the phone - it's a sort of accountability that's a little better than an email or her parents. (Though, I know more work for already busy teachers.) I appreciate that they try at all. Also, I think it would help my daughter if she was unable to get so far behind - because of stronger repercussions than are currently in place. Other teens were openly admitting they were 50 lessons behind at a CCA event to my daughter. I think the kids need to feel the pain of that. If your sick or funeral, ok, but sometimes, they are so relaxed at home - in good ways, I think they can get lazy and lose focus. I guess the consequence comes when they are rushing at the end of semesters, but I wonder if its a real pain to teachers at the end. We took my child out for a few months - she wasn't being educated well in the new school, so we put her back in CCA quickly, and she was very happy, but I noticed she instantly was less responsible with timing on assignments. I want her to feel the pain of that a little more than she does, like losing points if she turns it in late -not just a \"temporary zero\" and a grumpy mom. In real life - things have to be done on time. It seems talking to other people \"Portfolios\" seem to get people behind the most.

Mrs. Glotfelty is abrupt, nasty, and intimidates my child so much so that my child refuses to ask her any questions. She critiques classroom work with responses such as \"this is awkward\" along with similar responses that are just as vague and nonspecific. Without specificity, a child cannot improve on whatever issue is supposedly being addressed. My child was a prolific poet and book writer but now has soured on the experience of expressing via written form solely due to the interactions with Mrs. Glotfelty. Additionally, I personally have double-checked Mrs. Glotfelty's critiques of my child's work and have found multiple occurrences of inaccuracy. For example, Mrs. Glotfelty stating that a particular piece of content is missing when, in fact, that specific content was in the next few sentences.

If I can't communicate with the one person I need to talk to after several days of attempting I'm not very pleased.  In my mind if I have to do it alone why don't I just home school myself.

He is currently at the top of his class and receives amazing feedback from his teacher on projects and assessments.  He tests at or above grade level on all iReady assessments and Dibels.  He, like his sister, has grown so much socially AND academically.  The shy kid that was terrified to give an incorrect answer is now the first one to raise his hand at field trips.  At home, he reads and reads and then reads some more.  In addition, I am amazed on a regular basis how much he has grown in math skills.

From academics to clubs and field trips, students can have a full school experience in this setting, and an experience that is personalized just for the individual.",null,null,null,null,"we are happy as a family with CCA. The communication with the transition to charter academy has been very good at this point, I hope communication stays current and we get updates (positive and negative) as soon as possible.","Overall, tough curriculum but super supportive teachers and staff/along with therapies offered.  Lesson interactions are a huge part to a student's success.","We choose this school for our son to  be able to do his school work on his own time (mostly late afternoon/evenings).  Most teachers were fine and good with this, but I feel he was penalized by his English teacher for this.  With A's in all subjects but English, I feel it is the teacher more than the CCA as a whole.",null,"Please see answer to previous question.",null,null,"n/a",null,null,null,null,null,"Again, we are fairly new but myself and my son so far have been really pleased.   I would ask that during Live Lessons that teachers control the unrelated comments and questions from students.  Even though it's not in a real classroom, it is distracting from the subject matter and a waste of time.  I realize it's impossible to control it completely, but I think more need to be more strict about not allowing it.",null,"The flexibility for attendance and homework assignments are wonderful.  We no longer have to stress about handing in doctor notes for missed days due to appointments and not knowing the material for a test because the teacher doesn't feel like taking the time to cover what she missed when she was absent due to health reasons (and she had asked several times for help, only to be told she should already know the material).  The CCA teachers and staff on the other hand are wonderful!",null,"CCA listened to our thoughts on our son's education. His traditional school told us he would get what he needs but he never did. CCA gave him exactly what he needed from the start as they first listened to what we as parents had to say, then they looked at all of his documentation from school; report cards, testing, test scores and actual work he had done. Finally he was in classes that challenged him and have kept him interested with multiple ways of learning. We can't thank CCA enough for realizing he was an individual and needed to be treated as one.",null,"I only have 1 small complaint. And it is with when some of the science projects are. They will ask the kids to do experiments with dirt in the middle of the winter when the ground is frozen solid. Maybe they could be rearranged to either the early fall or spring. Other wise our family has had just an absolutely wonderful time with this school. Thank you so much for everything.",null,"Things are awesome","We love this program. But the one thing I wish we could change is the PSSA schedule. I would prefer to get the testing done in 1 or 2 full days vs 4 to 5 half days.",null,"Elementary school has been awesome.  We haven't had any issues with middle school either.  High school should revert back to letting the teachers have livelessons for their own classes only, and not the whole grade.","Please see this note by an instructor:  \r\nYou had 1a, 2, 3 correct on the Google form \"Fixed Expenses and Earning Interest\".  I have updated your grade book.  I encourage you to rework those that were incorrect and resubmit the form.  Be sure to use your guided notes.

Thanks to all of you!\r\n","Same as 11.",null,"Thank you for giving me my son back. CCA is helping him to be a more flexible thinker. I like that CCA is constantly striving to improve and meet the needs of its many students, a daunting task.","I am very concerned with the serious decline in responsiveness.  I am hopeful that once all transitions have completed this will rebound back to the level I have been accustomed to over the past several years.  I also have heard rumors that new curriculum will be looked into.  I would hope that a committee would include some parents.  Please do not switch to K12.  We would definitely leave if that were the case.  It's terrible.","The live lessons are extremely helpful to my child.  We appreciate the time the teachers put into presenting valuable lessons.","We have really enjoyed our experience with CCA and hope that the same spirit of flexibility and helpfulness continues.","This is an awesome program and I have been extremely happy with it!","perfect","It is also a sad loss that I have twice offered to have CCA students have computer science meet-ups (e.g. for robotics, AI programming, programming contests, etc.) at Gettysburg College and that such offers have been ignored.  I realize this sounds puffed up, but think about it: a college professor who is one of the primary organizers for artificial intelligence education initiatives in this hemisphere freely offers CCA enrichment activities and ... *crickets chirping*\r\n\r\nThat and aforementioned reasons give me a negative impression of the academic commitment CCA is able to offer individuals at this level of scale.  It seems that CCA markets better than it delivers in my limited experience.\r\n","It's been an over all great experience and my daughter loves it.","Sad that field trips fill up so quickly. \r\nWish we got to see teachers more and more activities offered at the school with teachers and students.\r\n","Our experience has been positive and we do recommend it to others.  \r\n\r\nMy only drawback is the use of Common Core, mainly in Math.  Many of the teaching concepts, just seem to be more aggravating than helpful.",null,"My son has asked to go back to school with his friends. We like the opportunity we have with CCA to know what he is learning when he is learning.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to be able to select certain classes to place my son in for the SYNC program as I see value. But some classes not all.","Overall great experience for the past 3 years.  I would like my kids to have access to Reading Eggs, Smarty Ants.  They tested too high to be able to have access to these resources.","There needs to be better communication and response time to webmails and voicemails left.",null,"Please see my thoughts on previous question.  Everyone is doing great and I know you are trying to  offer a great alternative to traditional learning environments.  The one thing I see that always stands out Is the great continuity between teachers, staff, activities directors etc... I don't think we have every had a glitch with one thing thus far.  Someone, somewhere is doing a great job at keeping everything organized and flowing smoothly.",null,"My daughter loves CCA and would never go back to a regular school.",null,null,"CCA is a God send for our family. My  son would have been left behind at the local school. I would have to privately homeschool if not for CCA. This is an affordable option to traditional public schools.","As parents, my wife and I are happy that we have a choice in where our daughter goes to school.  CCA provides that option and the flexibility that we were looking for, as well as being more involved in the learning process.","I went to the Gettysburg field trip with the 5th graders. I was very disappointed in the lack of communication that the teachers gave to the students. Besides of the first 5 minutes of saying \"Hello\" and a brief talk. That was all the communication was between the student and the teacher. I feel that the teacher's where not there for the students. That they were only their for themselves. My daughter's teacher (Ms. Theil) was to involved in her boyfriend and the other teacher (Mrs Roth). I felt that it was very unprofessional. This was the only time that they can meet their teacher's and to have an experience like that very disappointed! I will think twice next time before I will go on a field trip. I feel sorry for the parents that drove hours away.","Keep up the good work.  We are pleased so far.","I regret enrolling my 5 year old in the kindergarten curriculum. She dreads school most days. I feel like this is more of a 1st grade curriculum. However she is beginning to read so we are happy about that. I feel like with this K curriculum you would need to be reading at the beginning of the school year for it to not be stressful.","As previously addressed the chasm in the special education department MUST be fixed ASAP. Being out of compliance with IEP's directly effects charter renewal and enrollment which speaks directly to health of the school. Fixing the gaps and issues in the department should be a priority for the school administration and leadership. Personally, I am disappointed with management not making this a priority.",null,null,"Our experience with CCA has been good overall.  We've had understanding and good teachers.

My son's teacher's knew that my sons had a neurological conditions, because I told then at our first phone call, but they never seen it as a burden, instead their teachers wanted to know what they could do to help make sure that my son's got the best learning experiment possible at CCA.","Helped daughter get away from truancy.","my children feel there is too much work. Other than that, everything is good.\r\n\r\nI'm happy they switched my son to a lower math class appropriate to him (from his last years PSSA results).  But he wasn't switched until almost 2 months in, when I supplied copies with registration.  Then it was hard for him to catch up his work and lessons in the new class, which further frustrated him initially.  It was determined that he would have his own set schedule of work to comprehend the lessons from the beginning and not to follow the current live lesson classes",null,"The teachers are great!

Our son has made major progress with Mr. Lawrence, Miss Stumpf, Mrs Pulizzi and Mr. Wolfe.  Those in charge of my sons IEP dropped the ball by explaining their hands are tied and the Math/Read 180 program is the only way special education students will be taught at CCA.  Vendors and Psychologist should not dictate how a student should learn.  An IEP should be created by teachers that actually work with the student not a School Psychologist that has no idea of actual skill level and no Special Education certification.  Not happy with the  over testing at her suggestions and the confusion created over a simple goal modification, two months and no IEP meeting yet.  Started February 8th, 2016, no meeting yet, just cancelations, and excuses.","Over all the teachers are very helpful, but the communication between Admin and teachers is highly lacking.  Which affects all students especially Special Education students in a negative way.  4 Staff changes in Social studies from September to March is too much!","We find that the portfolios are sometimes difficult to understand, making it frustrating.

This was not a smooth transition for a new parent to CCA.",null,"Other than the poor field trips this year, things are well.

Both of my children have enjoyed their time with CCA and have benefited greatly from it.",null,null,null,"i would like to thank the teachers and staff for being there for my child during the school years!","I feel the #1 thing CCA can do to keep academically advanced students (aka improve pssa scores) is to distinguish between those who want public school at home (and will rely heavily on teachers and LL) and those who want home school with support (and will be self taught, only needing minimal assistance). I feel CCA is getting better at that in the elementary grades, but it is also needed in middle and high school.  Without this distinction, CCA will continue to lose academically advanced students to traditional home school or other options that truly foster a 'work and your own pace' environment. Thank you for the opportunity to share my thoughts.","I am extremely pleased with my son's 3rd grade teacher Mrs. Sarah Everitt. She has been the most helpful and very sweet and kind to myself and my son.","Both boys did K at the local B&amp;M.

My son encountered never ending bullying at our local public school which caused him extreme anxiety and affected his academic performance.  CCA has provided a safe learning environment, excellent curriculum, and stellar teacher support.  Thank you CCA!","CCA offered my daughter an alternative when she most needed one. Traditional school was not working for her. The classes and teachers in her first year here were what really swayed us. She made connections with several of the teachers and would have enjoyed more classes with them. They went out of their way to help. She is a hard sell so this was not an easy thing to do.

At the beginning of the year I contacted tech support to install the software. It worked great - no problems. During February, there was a problem with my daughter's computer. When tech support was contacted, they directed us to return the computer to them for maintenance. Approximately 1-2 weeks later we received a new laptop. There was no notification that the computer no longer had the security software installed. I did not discover this until nearly 2 weeks later when I noticed my daughter was falling behind on her lessons. Upon investigation, I noted that she was spending time on Facebook and Pokemon.com. I contacted tech support and had the new security software installed; however, I also noted that failure to notify me that the software was no longer on the computer was unacceptable. I tried to convey that a simple notification - perhaps on the shipping email that is sent, would be helpful; however, they did not see an issue with this. I realize that no software is 100% when limiting access to certain material, but had I been notified that the software was no longer loaded, I would have immediately called tech support to have it re-installed.","We have been very happy with CCA.  The program has made it possible for us to do volunteer work, provide work experience and job training for our students.  We could not do this in another program.

Also, there are pilot programs in some local districts here to include some cyber schooling in their programs because it is cheaper for them to develop a program than to lose the tax money to you guys. They are distributing tablets and new generation laptops. If this continues, you guys are not going to have much of an advantage at all.","Most of our interaction with staff has been excellent.  In my opinion, parents need to be just as involved whether it is in a bricks-and-mortar school, or in a cyber school. It takes BOTH parental involvement and teacher/staff input to help a child succeed and achieve the desired results.  The teachers need the parents/coaches and the parents/coaches need the teachers to help resolve difficulties in the educational process.","It would be nice for my daughter to work ahead when she has the time but most if not all of the teachers frown on this.","This type of education is excellent for the right student. Being a good learning coach, however, requires a tremendous commitment of time and energy.  It literally changes one's life.  That causes me to wonder how well this model fits most families' lives, especially when so many families are two earner families.  I have no answers to this dilemma, but I do suggest that it is an issue that needs to be considered.  What infrastructure can be created to make up for the fact that, in most families, coaching on a regular basis is not realistic?","CCA has worked out very well for our family, however, I think it is not for most families.  I say this because I know what it takes to be a learning coach.  I changed my life to do this, and I am not gainfully employed.  I spend many hours working with my children, and I stay right on top of things.  Many learning coaches don't do this, and some may not have the emotional or intellectual wherewithal (or the time).  The program is only as good as its curriculum, instructors and learning coaches.  If one of these is weak, the whole system is weak.  You have control over two of these.  CCA, and cyber schools in general, have to think through how to provide more support on the family side.  For example, should there be places where kids can come and participate each day as a group, with hired coaches?","As of right now, I have no comments.","My children love this learning atmosphere.",null,null,null,"It is a great school with great teachers.

I can appreciate the need to carefully observe the budget, however I feel my children have lost too many oppurtunities to learn hands on and socialize.  I specifically chose CCA because of the many field trips.  The curriculm at CCA is great and I feel my children are learning at a rate exceeding B&amp;M but the down fall of cyber school is the chance to interact with other children in an educational and social enviroment.  But the decrease in avaliablity of field trips due to money has decreased those oppurtunities.  My children never complain about their CCA lesson and do not wish to return to B&amp;M but they have vocalized serveral times how much they miss being with friends.  I have also observed many amazing field trips being cancelled because not enough people signed up which I feel is without a doubt because of the new rule.  I know to many this \"complaint\" seems ridiculous because money is better spent on supplies and education, however my opinion is along with the great education CCA offers being face to face with other kids is equally important for an overall healthy educational experience.  I hope you can reevaluate the field trip policies to help structure a truely well rounded learning experience!","You have a good thing going here, don't mess with it too much.",null,null,null,null,"Great","none","I know I complain sometimes, but I feel I have a voice at CCA.

My family and I were just discussing cyber school recently and came to the conclusion that CCA really is the best choice for us in cyber education. We also set some boundaries: should biometrics appear in the school, or should the curriculum so deeply offend our standards that there is no further working around it, we will begin home school. Nevertheless, we will always be grateful that CCA was there for us when we HAD to get out of B&amp;M school. We have been with CCA for 8 years.

Everything has been provided to help make a great learning experience and environment for our child. The accountability that is present from the teachers to the students and learning coaches is great.

We personally feel with how the curriculum is set up, check-ins, the communications from teacher to students and learning coaches, as well as other areas requires activity and active learning.  Children and the parents we feel and appreciate at CCA are not just sitting around,  CCA has helped our child with time management skills, transitioning skills, self-initiative and so much of a sense of accomplishment.

The brutal and unacceptable things that happen on a daily basis would have a severely negative impact on our daughter. After some research and suggestions from close friends we chose CCA. This was the best decision we made thus far in her life! It is a learning experience for our entire family. Her older siblings (1 adult brother and 1 brother in 12th at our public school) get involved and help out which makes her very happy. She gets to have a multitude of input in her daily routine and what she want to learn first. Our Family mentor, Sherri Stormer, and her daughter have been a god sent since day one! Sherri  has helped my daughter overcome so much in such a short time. We would be lost without her! Her classmates and their families are truly wonderful people and strive for the best from their children, and it shows.

In 3 years he has only had one teacher that was difficult to work with. The only downside to being in a program like this is that he does miss being with other kids and he will be missing out on social experiences at a brick and mortar high school. However, if a child is ok with that I think this is an excellent program. Again, I like that the teachers work to keep kids \"honest\". They can tell who's doing the work and who's not and that is exactly why I chose this school.","CCA is a great school. Anyone that we have talked to has had the same experience that we have had.

It appears to me that even before I have a chance to view what is offered some are already filled up and there is a waiting list.  This makes it seem that some families know ahead of time what is being offered.  Maybe one suggestion is that each family should only be allowed to sign up for a certain number of field trips a year so other families could have an opportunity.","I wish CCA would look into the content of their curriculum and make them more age appropriate. My kindergartener did not need to learn about budgets and percentages in Social Studies this year. Also, I feel that having a kindergartener read a new book every day in LA is a little too much.

I really think my child needs a more one on one with her teachers. It really frustrates to watching my daughter struggle through subjects due to the lack of understanding and watching my child get confused on her educations sure scares me. I do not know if she is just getting lazy or if she really doesn`t remember what she is learning. When that skip over lessons it confuses me how she is going to learn anything when the remove it. I can some understanding from certain teachers more than others and sometimes through a mentor but still not enough to understand the whole process. I get very angry hearing a teacher either put words in our mouths when we need more clarification on things or they say maybe what we need is a home visit but nobody has ever sent anyone to our home to help out which then only adds to more frustration and anger. Now we just got to pray next year we get more help in what we need soo my child can get an education without so much frustration.

I cant thank CCA enough for lifting her spirits and giving her a great school experience.","Do not like rap , don't believe it is music don't  like it shoved in my kids faces . In the program flocabulary . There  I'm sure are better programs without that junk they call music to teach the children.  Some of us like Christian music not that junk .

There is little help with finding all the information needed when learning to go through all the areas of the program. Parent mentor didn't respond. The parents are told that teachers are readily available for help but aren't. New people are just expected to know or find info that is hard to locate &amp; even use if you don't already know them. Things like the course tree, scheduler, resource links, answers keys etc (little hints/tricks/everday shortcuts that only people that have been here awhile know about but teacher expect you to use or locate without help. The amount of links, assignments, work pages, portfolios, reading etc expected for every assignment (class) cannot be done in the time frame stated.

He is someone that demands perfection in everything that he does and when he came to CCA that's exactly what he got, PERFECTION! The teachers are very good at what they do and how they teach, if a student does not catch the concept the way the teacher is presenting it then the teacher will show the student other ways in which to understand. The curriculum is challenging and well worth it, after all you are here to learn to be the best person that you can be. Time management and scheduling has proven to be a great part of life with CCA. My son is graduating this year and although we will miss CCA they have done a fabulous job at preparing him for the many challenges that he will face in the future. He has always taken AP and Honor courses and with all of his hard work he will be graduating with honors. He will be attending a four year college for his bachelors degree and then moving on to get his masters, and doctor's degree in American History.

Having a local PAC office in Erie was nice but given the economic conditions and low CCA enrollment here it is understandable why CCA could not have a satellite office but why not look into having a \"satellite room or desk\" perhaps donated by a local business, law firm, hospital or educational institution where a CCA rep could come once or twice a week and service students  and encourage new enrollments by having ( or being close to where they could set up)  lectures, lessons, get together's, robotic clubs,  STEM, do evaluations/testing etc.  Erie has local student theater/ playhouse, ballet, junior philharmonic, Box of Light (Robotics), Tom Ridge  Environmental Center, Brig Niagara/ Maritime museum -  things that are occasional field trips but have never been tapped on a regular basis for more in depth educational opportunities for students in the area.....Having  a CCA rep traveling I 79 each week would go from one end of the state --Erie  to the other - Pittsburgh","no comments\r\n",null,"CCA is truly an exceptional school.
